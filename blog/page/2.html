<p>Gum disease is one of our most common dental diseases, affecting both children and adults. If you are considering getting braces or aligners, make sure your gums are their healthiest before beginning orthodontic treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gingivitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For both younger and older patients, gingivitis (mild gum disease) can be the result of poor brushing and flossing habits. When plaque builds up around the teeth and gums, it irritates delicate gum tissue. The gums become inflamed, and symptoms such as redness, swelling, tenderness, bleeding, and bad breath can result. Usually, your dentist can treat early stages of gingivitis with tips on more efficient brushing and flossing, a professional cleaning, and suggestions for mouth rinses if needed.</p>
<p>Because brushing and flossing with braces can be more difficult, you need to devote special attention to your cleaning routine to prevent gingivitis from developing <em>after</em> you start treatment. Talk to us any time about how to brush and floss most effectively when you wear braces. Drs. Insoft and Hurst can also recommend tools designed especially for braces wearers to get your teeth and gums as clean and plaque-free as possible. If you are a candidate for clear aligners, this option can make it easier to keep your teeth their cleanest. We&rsquo;ll work with you to keep your gums healthy as your orthodontic work takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodontitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For older patients, gingivitis, left untreated, can eventually lead to periodontitis (severe gum disease). This chronic infection can lead to the formation of pockets between your gums and teeth that become home to bacteria and infection. Over time, periodontitis can lead to the destruction of gum, ligament, and bone tissue. Left untreated, it can lead to loose teeth and even bone and tooth loss.</p>
<p>Making sure you schedule regular dental exams will allow your dentist or periodontist to detect and treat any signs of periodontitis as early as possible. If you have any of the symptoms of gum disease, it&rsquo;s important to treat the cause of these symptoms as soon as possible to protect your gums, bone, and teeth. Deep cleaning procedures such as scaling and root planing, topical and oral antibiotics, and oral surgeries such as flap surgery or bone and tissue grafting can help reverse the effects of periodontitis.</p>
<p>Because orthodontic treatment involves moving the teeth and re-forming the ligament and bone tissue, which hold them in place, you need healthy periodontal ligaments and bones to begin treatment. If you have suffered shifting teeth or bone loss due to periodontitis, talk to us. We will let you know at your visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office if you are a good candidate for orthodontic work, and which type of appliance is best for your periodontal health.</p>
<p>We are happy to talk to you about the best way to achieve an attractive smile and a healthy bite if gum disease has been a problem in the past. Most important, we want to make sure that your teeth and gums are their healthiest even before you begin orthodontic treatment. Preventing and treating gum disease will provide the foundation you need for a lifetime of beautiful smiles.</p>

  <h2><a href="../2020/09/tooth-extraction-and-braces.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Tooth Extraction and Braces">Tooth Extraction and Braces</a></h2>
  <h3>September 9th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/09/tooth_extraction_braces.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard from parents or older relatives what braces used to be like years ago&mdash;obvious, uncomfortable, hard to clean, and with inevitable tooth extractions to start off the whole lengthy process.</p>
<p>Today, brackets are much smaller and wires are more pliable. You can even choose ceramic brackets or clear aligners for an almost invisible effect. New tools make cleaning your braces easier than ever. And new braces technology means that treatment is often shorter. But what about extractions? Are they still inevitable?</p>
<p>For orthodontists like Drs. Insoft and Hurst, the objective is <em>saving</em> teeth. And modern practices and technology have made this goal more attainable than ever before. There are several ways that modern treatment procedures can help avoid extractions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that children visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for an orthodontic evaluation by age seven. Because a child&rsquo;s jaw is still forming at this age, early intervention can lead to orthodontic treatment that expands the jaw in order to make room for permanent teeth, or starts correcting bite problems before they become more serious.</p>
<ul>
<li>High-Tech Planning</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s technology allows us to map out the progression of your treatment before we begin. Scanners, X-rays, and computer programs help us to design a treatment plan which will accurately predict how best to move your teeth and correct your bite, taking into account the size and development of your teeth and jaw.</p>
<ul>
<li>Surgical Options</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time you reach your late teen years, the jaw bones have stopped growing and it&rsquo;s no longer possible to expand them without surgery. Oral surgery can treat serious jaw problems that impact your teeth and bite, usually as part of a combined treatment plan designed by your orthodontist and your oral surgeon.</p>
<p>Because we always work to keep teeth intact&mdash;using these methods and others&mdash;you can be sure that, if we recommend extraction, it is absolutely necessary. What could make an extraction necessary?</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe overcrowding. Sometimes, there&rsquo;s just not enough room in the jaw for all of your teeth.</li>
<li>A tooth or teeth that prevent us from correcting a problem with your bite.</li>
<li>Wisdom teeth. Usually, orthodontic work takes place before a patient&rsquo;s wisdom teeth start to erupt. If yours do make an appearance before or during treatment, we can adapt our treatment plan accordingly.</li>
<li>An extra tooth. It&rsquo;s rare, but an extra, or supernumerary, tooth sometimes develops, and your jaw is not designed to accommodate extras!</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about every step of your treatment, including extractions. We want you to understand the treatment plan which will give you your best outcome. If we recommend extraction, it is because this decision is the best way to achieve a healthy bite and alignment, creating your beautiful smile&mdash;and protecting it&mdash;for a lifetime.</p>

  <h3>August 26th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/08/veggie_diet.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following a vegetarian or vegan diet, you know that there&rsquo;s much more to living a healthy life than simply avoiding meat products. Making sure your diet includes enough protein, as well as any nutrients that are primarily available in animal products, takes planning, and there&rsquo;s no one-menu-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>Why? Because there&rsquo;s no one menu that will suit all vegetarians. Specific vegetarian diets can allow for many different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vegan&mdash;a plant-based diet which excludes meat, fish, dairy, and egg products</li>
<li>Ovo-vegetarian&mdash;includes eggs as a dietary option, but no dairy</li>
<li>Lacto-vegetarian&mdash; includes dairy as a dietary option, but no eggs</li>
<li>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian&mdash;a meat-free diet which allows both dairy products and eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a pescatarian, who eats fish on occasion, or a flexitarian, who sometimes includes meat in a meal, your menu options are even broader.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the big picture&mdash;a healthy vegetarian diet is really more concerned with the foods you <em>do</em> eat for nutrition rather than the foods you <em>don&rsquo;t</em>. You can create a meal plan rich in all your essential nutrients with a little research, no matter which type of vegetarian diet is your go-to choice.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re constructing your ideal menu guidelines, don&rsquo;t forget about your dental nutrition!</p>
<p>In terms of keeping your teeth and gums their healthiest, what important vitamins and minerals are often missing from vegetarian and vegan diets? Let&rsquo;s look at three of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcium</li>
</ul>
<p>Calcium is essential for maintaining strong bones and tooth enamel. Without enough calcium, a weakened jawbone leads to loose, and even lost, teeth. The acids in our food and the acids created by oral bacteria also weaken the minerals in enamel, including calcium. These weak spots can eventually become cavities. A diet rich in calcium not only supports the bones holding our teeth, but can even help repair, or remineralize, enamel which has been weakened by acidic erosion.</p>
<p>For vegetarians who include dairy in their diets, dairy products are a great way to include calcium. Milk, cheese, and yogurt are traditional and rich sources of this mineral.</p>
<p>For vegans, it&rsquo;s a bit more challenging, but still doable! Non-dairy foods providing calcium include dark green vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach), certain types of tofu, and fortified cereals, juices, and non-dairy milks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to put that calcium to work by making sure you have enough vitamin D in your diet. Vitamin D not only helps keep our bones healthy, it also enables our bodies to absorb calcium. Bonus&mdash;it&rsquo;s been linked to better gum health in several studies.</p>
<p>So how to get more vitamin D? If you eat dairy, most dairy products have been fortified with vitamin D. If eggs are a part of your diet, egg yolks are a great source. Pescatarians can enjoy the benefits of vitamin D from fatty fish such as tuna and salmon.</p>
<p>Because we get most of our vitamin D from sun exposure or foods derived from animals, plant-based foods are not a practical way to obtain the vitamin D you need. But, just as non-vegetarians can get plentiful vitamin D from fortified dairy products, vegans also have options. Try adding cereals, juices, and non-dairy milks fortified with this essential nutrient to your diet, or take a vegan vitamin D supplement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B12</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B12 is essential for healthy red blood cells, nerve cell development, brain function, and DNA production. (This is why it&rsquo;s especially important for pregnant and nursing women.) Vitamin B12 can also impact your oral health. A B12 deficiency can cause a swollen, sore, or inflamed tongue, loss of taste, and gum, tongue, and mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, vitamin B12 is reliably found only in animal foods and nutritional yeasts. If you would prefer an egg-free and dairy-free diet, look to B12 supplements or B12-fortified cereals, plant-based milks, energy bars, and other vegan options. This is a good subject to discuss with your physician, because even supplements and fortified foods might not provide enough B12.</p>
<p>In fact, Drs. Insoft and Hurst can be vital resources when you&rsquo;re planning your healthiest vegetarian diet. The next time you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, ask for recommendations for supplements if you&rsquo;re concerned that diet alone can&rsquo;t provide for all of your nutrition essentials. Finally, care should be taken to ensure that, even with supplements, you get the proper amount of the vitamins and minerals you need.</p>
<p>As a vegetarian, you are used to the concept of care. Whether it was concern for nutrition, the planet, the animal world, or another reason that drew you to a vegetarian diet, be sure to care for your body as well as your dietary choices. Careful planning can ensure a diet which supports not only your general health, but your oral health, for a lifetime of nourishing&mdash;and well-nourished&mdash;smiles.</p>

  <h3>August 19th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/08/theres_an_app_for_that.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Modern orthodontic technology has led to major changes in the world of braces. Brackets are smaller and come in both metal and ceramic materials. Wires are more efficient and more comfortable. Elastic bands come in a variety of vivid colors, or you can choose brackets which work without bands. You can even decide on clear aligners, with no brackets or wires at all.</p>
<p>And since modern software technology has given us a program for just about everything, it&rsquo;s no surprise that you can install apps to help make your modern orthodontic treatment more convenient and more enjoyable. What can an orthodontic app do for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Track of Your <em>App</em>ointments</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many apps out there that are designed to help you keep your treatment on track with appointment reminders. This sounds pretty basic, but when you have school, work, sports, and activities filling your days, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get a timely reminder that our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office will be expecting you in the near future. And, since missed appointments delay your progress, you are making sure you achieve your beautiful, healthy smile in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>M<em>app</em>ing Out Your Routine</li>
</ul>
<p>You know how important it is to keep track of the hours you wear your aligners. Apps can help remove the guesswork with a timer to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the hours you need to progress to the next phase of treatment. Apps can also remind you when you&rsquo;re ready for a new aligner, and let you track your progress in one convenient place with selfies after each aligner transition. After all, it&rsquo;s really exciting to see just how far you&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>If you wear traditional braces, there are apps with very helpful reminders for you, too. For example, forgetting to wear your elastics can really delay your progress. An app can let you know when it&rsquo;s time to wear your rubber bands and keep track of your hours. It can also remind you to replace your bands regularly, because elastics become less elastic through the day. And take advantage of the countdown feature some apps offer to see just when you can expect to be done with your treatment when you keep on top of your routine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing and Flossing? <em>App</em>ly Yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p>A big part of making your smile look its best after your orthodontic treatment is making sure you take care of your smile <em>during</em> your treatment. This means keeping up with daily brushing and flossing, and using proper technique. Two minutes brushing, twice each day, and flossing at least once a day are the basic recommendations for preventing cavities and gum disease. (During orthodontic treatment, you might need to increase your brushing and flossing&mdash;ask us how often is best for your needs.)</p>
<p>And to help you make sure you get a solid two minutes of brushing twice a day? Try an app that plays two minutes of your favorite music with a perfectly timed brushing playlist. Apps can also send you brushing and flossing reminders, let you know when it&rsquo;s time to change your toothbrush (every three months, please!), and give you tips on better brushing and flossing techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have Fun with Your <em>App</em>earance</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure just how you&rsquo;ll look in braces? Get a preview with an app that uses one of your selfies to model different types and styles of braces, brackets, bands, and aligners. Metal brackets? Ceramic? Elastic bands in your favorite colors? No bands at all? Hardly visible aligners? Find the look that works for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>When Problems H<em>app</em>en</li>
</ul>
<p>Some apps will even guide you through common orthodontic problems, such as applying wax to an irritating bracket or relieving discomfort. Always remember, though, an app is not an orthodontist. If you have a serious problem or concern, call us immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodontist <em>App</em>roved</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve checked out the orthodontic apps available for your operating system, you know that there are a lot of options out there. If you&rsquo;re looking for an app providing information about your treatment, tips for dealing with your braces, or a convenient way to track your progress or even be part of a community, you want the best information, tips, and conveniences possible&mdash;and hopefully all in one place.</p>
<p>To help you find the best orthodontic app for you, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst! We might know just the app for your specific needs. Whether you choose aligners or brackets and wires, consider all the wire<em>less</em> options that can make your life easier, your dental care more complete, and&mdash;just maybe&mdash;your orthodontic experience a little more fun.</p>
