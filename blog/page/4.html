<p>No matter how careful you are, accidents can happen. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a slice of apple that was a little bit larger than it should have been. Or you were chewing on your pencil while you were trying to work out an algebra problem. Or you tried a piece of candy that your friend really, truly thought didn&rsquo;t have a caramel center.</p>
<p>No matter the cause, when something&lsquo;s wrong with your braces, you know it. And you want to fix it as soon as possible. What can you do to make yourself more comfortable? And which repairs are best left to orthodontic professionals?</p>
<p>First things first. If you have been injured, and suffered a trauma to your mouth or jaw that has damaged your braces, we want to make sure that you get any medical attention you might need before we worry about your appliance. Call Drs. Insoft and Hurst, and your doctor, immediately if you have suffered a medical or dental injury.</p>
<p>Even if your braces are the only injured party, you might need a special appointment if the damage is something that shouldn&rsquo;t wait and can delay your orthodontic progress. Broken wires, brackets that have fallen off, and loose orthodontic bands, for example, need to be replaced in our office.</p>
<p>But what about minor problems? First, call us to see if it&rsquo;s something that really <em>is</em> minor, and whether you can do some home repairs to keep you going until your next regular visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wayward Wires</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most common&mdash;and most annoying&mdash;problems is a broken or out-of-place wire. If a wire end is poking you, dental wax can be applied to the loose end to protect your cheeks and gums. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, we can let you know how to apply gentle pressure to move the wire away from delicate tissue. Don&rsquo;t try to cut a broken wire or remove it without talking to us&mdash;small pieces can be swallowed accidentally. We&rsquo;ll give you suggestions for how to handle a broken or loose wire and protect your mouth until you can see us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakaway Brackets</li>
</ul>
<p>If your bracket becomes loose, this is another good reason to give us a call. Brackets are specifically placed to let your archwire guide your teeth where they need to be. Without a firmly bonded bracket, the wire isn&rsquo;t doing you much good! If a loose bracket is irritating your cheeks or gums, you can try a bit of dental wax to stick it in place and cover hard edges until we can re-bond it. If the bracket comes off all together, bring it with you to your next appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balky Bands</li>
</ul>
<p>Spacers are little rubber bands we put between your teeth if we need to create some room between your molars before you get your braces. They have a tendency to fall out after several days. We&rsquo;ll let you know if their work is done, and you&rsquo;re ready to start your orthodontic treatment. If you lose one of your ligatures, those colorful bands around your brackets, give us a call and we&rsquo;ll let you know if replacement can wait.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re happy to help you with any braces problems, large or small. It&rsquo;s best to check with us for even small fixes to make sure you avoid injury. Larger repairs can be handled in our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office&mdash;and we can give you tips on how to prevent future ones. Accidents happen, but they don&rsquo;t need to delay your progress toward a beautiful, healthy smile.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/06/what_is_plaque.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>From the time you were small, you&rsquo;ve been warned about the dangers of plaque. Why? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s an unpleasant film that sticks to your teeth</li>
<li>It causes cavities</li>
<li>It causes gum disease</li>
<li>It can cause extra problems when you wear braces</li>
</ul>
<p>And really, do we need to know much more than this to motivate us to brush? But if you&rsquo;re in a curious mood, you might be wondering just how this soft, fuzzy film accomplishes all that damage. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the sticky problem of plaque.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque form?</strong></p>
<p>We live with hundreds of species of oral bacteria, most of which are harmless, and some of which are actually beneficial. But when our oral ecosystem gets out of balance, problems can occur. For example, without regular and thorough brushing and flossing, we start to build up plaque.</p>
<p>Plaque starts forming within hours of your last brushing. And even though plaque fits the very definition of &ldquo;seems to appear overnight,&rdquo; this biofilm is actually a complex microbial community with several different stages of development.</p>
<ul>
<li>It starts with saliva.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saliva is vital to our oral health, because it keeps us hydrated, washes away food particles, neutralizes acids in the mouth, and provides minerals which keep our enamel strong. Saliva also contains proteins, which help form a healthy, protective film on the tooth surface. This film is called a pellicle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria attach to the pellicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are species of oral bacteria that are able to attach themselves to the pellicle film within hours of its formation. As they become more firmly attached, they begin to grow and divide to form colonies, and are known as the early colonizers of the plaque biofilm.</p>
<ul>
<li>A complex biofilm forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve skipped brushing for a few days (please don&rsquo;t!), you&rsquo;ll notice a fuzzy, sometimes discolored film on your enamel&mdash;that&rsquo;s a thriving plaque community, and it only takes a matter of days to go from invisible to unpleasant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not removing plaque regularly, it can harden further and become tartar. And once you have tartar buildup, you&rsquo;ll need the care of a dental professional to remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if we ignore plaque and tartar?</li>
</ul>
<p>We get cavities and gum disease.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque cause cavities?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bacteria in plaque, like all organisms, need nutrients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our normal oral environment and the food in our everyday diets provide the nutrients plaque needs. And, as we mentioned above, certain types of oral bacteria convert these nutrients into acids. Foods such as carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are most easily converted into acids, which is why we recommend that you enjoy them in moderation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biofilm promotes acid production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the plaque film, anaerobic bacteria (bacteria which don&rsquo;t use oxygen) convert sugars and starches into acids. As the plaque film becomes denser, it blocks acid-neutralizing saliva and oxygen from reaching these bacteria close to the tooth&rsquo;s surface, creating an ideal environment for the bacteria to produce their acid waste products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acids attack enamel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sticky nature of plaque keeps these acids in contact with tooth enamel, where, over time, acids dissolve minerals in enamel, weakening the mineral structure of the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque cause gum disease?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria cause inflammation and gingivitis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bacteria in plaque irritate the delicate tissue of the gums, which causes an inflammation response which can leave your gums swollen, red, bleeding, or tender. This early form of gum disease is gingivitis. Fortunately, good dental care and careful brushing and flossing can usually prevent and even eliminate gingivitis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque and tartar can lead to periodontitis.</li>
</ul>
<p>When plaque and tartar build up around and below the gumline, the gums pull away from the teeth, leaving pockets where bacteria collect, leading to infection as well as inflammation. Infections and constant inflammation not only harm gum tissue, they can destroy the bone supporting the teeth. This serious gum condition is periodontitis, and should be treated immediately to avoid further infection and even tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque affect orthodontic patients?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque collects around your braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Braces provide plenty of spots for plaque to hide from your brush. If you aren&rsquo;t extremely diligent with your brushing and flossing, plaque collects near brackets, wires, and bands&mdash;all those spots that a brush and floss find difficult to reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque promotes demineralization</li>
</ul>
<p>The demineralization process we mentioned above can cause white spots on teeth (decalcification), where minerals have dissolved. Sometimes these spots can be treated, and sometimes they are permanent. They can become quite sensitive, and may lead to cavities.</p>
<p>Careful brushing and flossing around your braces will help eliminate the plaque that can cause demineralization near brackets. Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the tools and the brushing and flossing techniques which will give you the best results.</p>
<p><strong>How do we fight plaque?</strong></p>
<p>From the time you were small, you&rsquo;ve learned how to fight plaque:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush at least twice a day for two minutes, and be sure to brush all of your tooth surfaces and around the gumline.</li>
<li>Floss to remove plaque from between the teeth and near the gumline.</li>
<li>See your dentist as recommended for a thorough professional cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be proactive. If you have any questions, talk to us at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office about the best way to keep plaque at bay. We can show you the most effective ways to brush and floss, recommend anti-plaque toothpastes and rinses, even suggest plaque-revealing tablets if you&rsquo;re missing some trouble spots.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only brushed up on some plaque basics, because there is a lot more to discover about this complex biofilm. Happily, even with all there is to learn about plaque&rsquo;s growth and development, it&rsquo;s reassuring to know that getting <em>rid</em> of it is quite simple&mdash;with just a soft-bristled brush, some dental floss, and a few minutes of your time each day, you&rsquo;re on the way to a healthy, happy, plaque-free smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be chewing sugary, sticky gum while I&rsquo;m wearing my braces.&rdquo; Or perhaps, &ldquo;I should check with my orthodontist to see if this sugar-free gum is safe for my braces.&rdquo; And these are both great thoughts&mdash;but today, we&rsquo;re thinking about gums of a different sort!</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;ve been taking care of your teeth with regular brushing and flossing, you&rsquo;ve also been taking care of your gums. And now that you&rsquo;re wearing braces, your gums need a bit of special attention to keep them their healthiest.</p>
<p>We tend to think of gum disease as an adult problem. In fact, periodontitis, or serious gum disease, is one of the most common chronic infections in the adult population. But young gums need care, too! Gingivitis, a milder form of gum disease, is unfortunately a common problem for both children and adults.</p>
<p>Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by the build-up of plaque and tartar. When plaque builds up, it irritates delicate gum tissue. And while gingivitis is not as serious as periodontitis, the symptoms caused by this disease are nothing to smile about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness</li>
<li>Tenderness and soreness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Bad Breath</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already feeling a little tender or swollen after an adjustment, the added discomfort caused by gingivitis is the last thing you want. But even worse, neglected gingivitis can lead to more serious infections of gum and even bone tissue. Luckily, gingivitis is both preventable and treatable with proper dental care.</p>
<p>So, how to protect your gums? We have some suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing Better with Braces</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be hard to brush around your brackets and wires, but keeping these areas free of food particles and plaque makes for healthy gums&mdash;and fewer cavities! There are specially designed manual toothbrushes made for braces wearers, and tiny interproximal brushes that can reach tight spaces. Or, perhaps an electric toothbrush will do a better job for you. Just be sure to brush after each meal for the most complete removal of bacteria and plaque.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn New Flossing Techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder how on earth you&rsquo;ll get in between your teeth with your wires and brackets in the way. We have the answers! We know the best techniques for flossing your specific braces, and we&rsquo;ll recommend specially designed flossing tools to make the job easier. Water flossers can also be a great help for cleaning in tight spots. Be sure to make flossing part of your daily routine&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to remove plaque from places brushing just can&rsquo;t reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rinsing? Recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the best dental rinses for reducing plaque and tartar, or how gargling can help prevent irritation. And drink water! Water helps wash away plaque and bacteria, and is a great way to rinse teeth and braces if you absolutely can&rsquo;t brush after eating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with Professional Cleanings</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to keep up with your regular dental exams and cleanings. Your dentist or hygienist will be able to remove any plaque or tartar build up that home brushing can&rsquo;t handle.</p>
<p>We want your time in braces to be as healthy&mdash;and comfortable&mdash;as possible. If you have any gum discomfort, swelling, or sensitivity, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call. With prompt action, gingivitis can be treated, and with careful attention to your cleaning routine, gingivitis can be prevented altogether. Something to think about!</p>

  <h3>June 10th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>Our grandmothers and grandfathers, our moms and dads&mdash;we&rsquo;ve known them our whole lives. So, why are they so hard to shop for?</p>
<p>If your older family members have all the sweaters, socks, and scents they need, consider a gift that can make life a bit easier and perhaps a lot healthier&mdash;an electric toothbrush!</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important reason to choose an electric toothbrush is its effectiveness. Several studies have shown that regular use of an electric toothbrush leads to a marked reduction in plaque, that bacteria-filled film which sticks to the teeth and leads to cavities and gingivitis. And it&rsquo;s really no surprise that an electric brush can out-perform a manual brush.</p>
<p>Using a manual brush is not just a matter of applying toothpaste and scrubbing. Proper technique means short brush strokes at a 45-degree angle for the outer and inner surfaces of the tooth, thoroughly cleaning the uneven chewing surfaces of the molars, and brushing the inside of the front teeth with gentle vertical strokes. Meticulous cleaning of all these surfaces can be difficult, especially for people with dexterity issues.</p>
<p>Electric toothbrushes offer several options, from oscillating/rotating brushes to oscillating/rotating/pulsating models to brushes using sonic vibration technology. What they all have in common is the ability to remove plaque far more effectively than we can on our own, because they provide the equivalent of thousands and even tens of thousands of brushstrokes per minute, as opposed to the hundreds we can achieve by hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable Control</li>
</ul>
<p>An electric toothbrush can be not only more efficient, but also more comfortable for older brushers. For those with arthritis, limited mobility, injuries, or other health conditions, the larger handles can be easier to control and much more grip-friendly. And, with the work being done by the brush head, users avoid repetitive hand and wrist motion.</p>
<p>Also, the pressure applied to teeth and gums with an electric brush is designed to clean thoroughly while protecting the mouth. Heavy-handed manual brushing can irritate delicate gum tissue and even damage enamel over time. With an electric brush, users only need to guide it along teeth and gums as it supplies all the power needed. There are even pressure sensors available to warn users that their brushing is too vigorous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps, Anyone?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your grandfather likes to keep things old school, a basic model with a convenient two-minute timer and several cleaning modes will offer all the bells and whistles he needs. But if your nana has more Instagram followers than you do, consider a more tech-savvy option.</p>
<p>Several of today&rsquo;s electric brushes come with features designed to make brushing even more effective. They can let her know if she&rsquo;s brushing long enough, alert her if she&rsquo;s brushing too hard, and remind her that it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Some models link to handy apps that will map out just where she&rsquo;s brushed, in case there are a few spots that get overlooked. Or choose a model which comes with a travel case that can recharge while she&rsquo;s busy seeing the world.</p>
<p>Okay, all that being said, we&rsquo;ll admit it&mdash;a toothbrush might not be the most glamorous gift your grandparent unwraps on that special day. But helping a favorite family member brush more effectively and comfortably while improving dental health? That&rsquo;s a gift that keeps on giving!</p>
