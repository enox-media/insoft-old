<p><strong>Press Pause</strong></p>
<p>If you are getting braces in the near future, it&rsquo;s very important to see your regular dentist first. That way, any cavities or other dental problems can be treated before your first orthodontic appointment at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</p>
<p><strong>Play it Safe</strong></p>
<p>Once you have your braces, you&rsquo;ll hearing a lot about how you need to be especially careful with your dental hygiene. Why? Because wires and brackets are obstacles to getting your teeth and gum area their cleanest. Plaque and food particles tend to stick to braces, and all too often can be missed while brushing. Plaque builds up around your gum line and brackets, and, in a very short time, can lead to sensitivity, demineralization, and cavities.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do to prevent tooth decay?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase Your Brushing Time</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of brushing twice a day, start brushing for two minutes after every meal. Put together a travel bag with a small toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and interproximal brushes to clean your teeth when you&rsquo;re on the go. If you absolutely can&rsquo;t brush, rinse carefully with water, and then brush as soon as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flossing&mdash;More Important than Ever</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the flossing tools designed just for braces to make sure you&rsquo;ve removed food particles and plaque from around your braces and gums. A water flosser can be helpful if manual flossing isn&rsquo;t effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Up with Your Regular Dental Care</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule regular checkups and professional cleanings at your dentist&rsquo;s office. They will be able to remove plaque you might miss at home. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow Our Advice</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to brush and floss, what products to use, and diet suggestions (such as keeping sugary and sticky foods off the menu and away from your braces). If we notice plaque building up around your gums and brackets, we&rsquo;ll let you know that you need to step up your hygiene habits. We can also suggest rinses and toothpastes that help fight plaque.</p>
<p>But if, despite all your efforts, you do get a cavity? There are options!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring Your Cavity?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Not</em> an option. You shouldn&rsquo;t wait until you are out of braces to get a cavity treated. This just gives decay a chance to spread further.</p>
<ul>
<li>Working With Your Braces</li>
</ul>
<p>Repairing a cavity means removing the decay in the tooth, cleaning the area, and then filling the tooth. If your cavity isn&rsquo;t located near your bands, brackets, or wires, your dentist might be able to work around your braces, and you can get your cavity treated during a regular dental appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing Parts of Your Braces for Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a cavity is located in a spot that your dentist can&rsquo;t reach because of your braces. In that case, we&rsquo;re able to coordinate with your dentist and remove a wire or bracket temporarily so you can have your tooth filled. Make an appointment to replace your bracket and re-attach your wire, and you&rsquo;ll be back on schedule as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Forward</strong></p>
<p>Keep your eyes on your goal--you&rsquo;re in braces because you want a beautiful smile. Keeping on top of your dental health is an essential part of creating that smile. Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about tips for getting your teeth their cleanest. If you do develop a cavity, we&rsquo;ll help you figure out the best way to treat it without causing too much delay in your orthodontic treatment. Taking care of your teeth now is the best way to create a future of beautiful smiles!</p>

<p>When you get braces as a child, you usually present the orthodontist with a blank canvas&mdash;newly erupted, perfect permanent teeth, just waiting to be aligned. But if you are a bit older, your canvas might already be a bit busy, with fillings, crowns, perhaps even a missing tooth. Can Drs. Insoft and Hurst still work with that more complicated picture? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fillings</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of us have acquired a filling or two. Normally, an old filling shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with new braces. Large fillings, however, might call for spacers. These small rubber bands are inserted between two teeth as needed to create enough room for bands and brackets, and are generally put in place a week or two before you get your braces. They frequently fall out on their own as the space between the teeth gets a bit wider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowns</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have had a root canal or any other dental treatment that left you with a crowned tooth, no need to be concerned. A special dental adhesive can be used to adhere brackets to crowns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implants</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have or would like to get an implant, this is a time to coordinate with your orthodontist and dentist or oral surgeon. Sometimes an implant can anchor your appliance, and sometimes it&rsquo;s best to keep the spot open until your orthodontic work is completed. Once in place, an implant will not have the mobility of a tooth, so it&rsquo;s always best to make sure your doctors can create a schedule that will work for both the installation of the implant and the positioning of your braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy Teeth and Gums</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin orthodontic work, talk to your dentist. If you need a filling or crown, are considering a dental implant, have symptoms of gum disease, or are looking at any other dental concerns, you should work with your dentist first. Healthy teeth and gums are the very best foundation for orthodontic treatment at <em>any</em> age.</p>
<p>If you are wondering whether Drs. Insoft and Hurst can help you achieve the smile you&rsquo;ve always wanted, talk to us when you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office! Your past dental work will be just one of the many variables we take into consideration when we&rsquo;re planning your future of picture-perfect smiles.</p>

<p>Plaque is a sticky subject! It sticks to the enamel of our teeth above and below the gum line, and it collects around braces. Plaque is one of the major causes of tooth decay and gum disease, and our teeth are under daily attack by this filmy menace.</p>
<p>What are the facts about plaque, and how can we fight back? Read on for some effective strategies!</p>
<p><strong>What Is Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Plaque is a sticky film that builds up on our teeth, largely made up of millions of different types of oral bacteria. Plaque is a colorless biofilm at first, but as it collects, it takes on a white or yellow tint. If you haven&rsquo;t brushed for a few days, that fuzziness you feel on your teeth is plaque build-up. Unless it&rsquo;s removed, plaque hardens within a matter of days to become tartar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: You can remove plaque with careful brushing and flossing, but it takes a dental professional to remove tartar. Be proactive!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Does Plaque Cause Cavities?</strong></p>
<p>Bacteria in plaque use our food as their food, especially sugars and carbs. They can then transform these nutrients into acids, which attack our tooth enamel, weakening it and leaving it vulnerable to further erosion and eventual decay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Cavities aren&rsquo;t the only damage caused by accumulated plaque. Plaque also collects along and below the gum line. If tartar forms here, it irritates delicate gum tissue, leading to gingivitis and more serious gum disease. Make sure you don&rsquo;t forget your gums when you brush and floss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Does Plaque Build Up?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer? Plaque is always forming, because oral bacteria are a natural part of our biology. (In fact, there are even oral bacterial which are beneficial.) Plaque starts building up within minutes after eating, and during the night as we sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we recommend brushing for two minutes at least twice a day, and flossing at least once a day. When you wear braces or aligners, brushing more often is a good idea. Food collecting around braces or inside aligners is a feast for plaque! Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst for suggestions for your best brushing schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Just because plaque is unavoidable, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to give the bacteria in plaque any additional encouragement. Every time you have a meal or a snack that&rsquo;s heavy in carbs and sugars, you are providing more fuel for acid production. Cutting down on foods like sugary desserts and sodas is not only nutrition-healthy, it&rsquo;s tooth-healthy!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where Does Plaque Collect?</strong></p>
<p>Plaque builds up all over tooth surfaces, at the gum line, and even below the gum line. It&rsquo;s especially easy to miss in hard-to-reach places like the irregular surfaces of molars, between the teeth, behind our front teeth, and near the gum line. Plaque also collects around your braces, and requires special care to make sure your teeth don&rsquo;t suffer cavities or the white spots caused by demineralization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: One of the ways plaque avoids detection is its invisibility. Fortunately, if you&rsquo;re having trouble brushing away all your plaque, there are plaque-disclosing toothpastes and chewable tablets available in the dental aisle which reveal the plaque hiding between, behind, or around your teeth by tinting it with a can&rsquo;t-miss color. Just brush the color away, and you&rsquo;ve brushed the plaque away as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Do We Clean Away Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Use the Right Tools</p>
<p>Floss at least once a day. There are different materials, sizes, and coatings for floss, so you can find one that&rsquo;s comfortable for you. Floss reaches those spots in between teeth and around the gum line that brushes miss.</p>
<p>Choose a soft toothbrush (soft bristles are better for your enamel) and change it every three to four months, or as soon as the bristles show wear. Make sure the head is the right size&mdash;too big, and it&rsquo;s not only uncomfortable, but you won&rsquo;t be able to reach all the surfaces you need to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips: There are special dental flosses created just for your braces. You can also use interproximal brushes water flosser to clean around wires and brackets. If you have trouble removing plaque around your teeth and braces with a manual toothbrush, consider an electric model. Several studies have shown a reduction in plaque with the use of an electric brush.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Right Toothpaste</p>
<p>There are many toothpastes specifically formulated to fight plaque and tartar. And fluoride toothpastes not only fight cavities, they can strengthen your enamel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Studies have shown that toothpastes with baking soda, in particular, are effective in reducing plaque. Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst for a recommendation the next time you&rsquo;re at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Right Technique</p>
<p>What not to do?&nbsp; A forceful, horizontal sawing motion is awkward, hard on your enamel, and misses plaque and debris between the teeth. Technique is important&mdash;not for style points, but for cleaner teeth!</p>
<p>Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle, especially at the gum line, to gently remove plaque from teeth and gums. Use short strokes or a circular motion to clean as much of the surface and between the teeth as possible. Brush the inside of your front teeth with careful vertical strokes&mdash;remember, that&rsquo;s one place where plaque is easy to overlook. The same holds true for the tops of your molars, so thoroughly clean those uneven surfaces.</p>
<p>If you wear braces, be sure to clean thoroughly around brackets and wires, where plaque can accumulate quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: If you wear clear aligners, don&rsquo;t forget to give them a gentle brushing as well! Plaque can stick to aligners, causing discoloration and odors, so follow our cleaning instructions carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who Can Help You Fight Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you do your best at home, plaque can still be a sticky problem. That&rsquo;s why we advise regular professional cleanings, which not only remove any plaque that&rsquo;s hiding away, but also eliminate any built-up tartar around your braces. And, of course, there you can learn all about how to keep your teeth their cleanest.</p>
<p>True, you&rsquo;re fighting plaque every day, but you have all the tools you need to make sure your teeth and gums stay healthy. You&rsquo;re winning the battle with plaque every time you eat a nutritious meal, and every time you brush and floss. With that kind of strategy, plaque doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance. And your bright smile and healthy teeth and gums? That&rsquo;s a victory worth celebrating!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following your dentist&rsquo;s advice, you know that you should be devoting two minutes twice a day to gentle, thorough brushing, and floss carefully at least once a day. It&rsquo;s automatic. It&rsquo;s habit. You&rsquo;re in the zone. Now that you have braces or aligners, though, it&rsquo;s time to step up your game!</p>
<p><strong>Removing Food Particles</strong></p>
<p>No one wants to worry about food particles stuck in braces right after lunch&mdash;or, worse, noticed hours after lunch! Because food tends to stick around brackets and wires, Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL team recommend brushing after a meal. Not only will you be confident in your smile, you&rsquo;ll be improving your dental health.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p><strong>Better Plaque Removal</strong></p>
<p>Plaque is a sticky film containing acid-producing bacteria. These acids lead to weakened enamel and, eventually, cavities. Careful brushing with a fluoride toothpaste helps eliminate plaque. But as you may have discovered, it can be more difficult to clean around brackets and wires. Brushing after eating will help keep plaque from forming on your enamel, and using the right tools (floss made for braces and interproximal brushes) will help clean plaque more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>But what about aligners?</strong></p>
<p>If you wear clear aligners, you take them out when you eat. This avoids the problem of food particles trapped in brackets and difficulty brushing around wires. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean you are home free. Brushing after every meal is also a good idea when you wear aligners.</p>
<p>Our teeth have an organic way to help remove food particles, acids, and bacteria between brushings&mdash;saliva! Your aligners, while covering your teeth, decrease their exposure to saliva. It&rsquo;s really important, then, to make sure you brush after eating. Otherwise, food particles and acids can remain on your teeth after you replace your aligners, increasing the risk of enamel erosion and decay.</p>
<p>Brushing helps keep your aligners clear as well. If you notice aligner discoloration, this could be the result of food residue such as tomato sauce or coffee that remained on the teeth after a meal. Anything that stains your enamel can stain your aligners. And don&rsquo;t forget about plaque. Plaque can stick not only to your enamel but to your aligners as well. If you notice that your aligners are cloudy, or have an unpleasant odor, talk to us about the best way to keep them their cleanest.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Plan</strong></p>
<p>So, what can you do to make brushing more convenient during a busy day? Be prepared! Keep a small kit with you containing a travel brush, a small tube of toothpaste, floss, and an interproximal brush for quick cleanings when you&rsquo;re out and about, and you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about your smile.</p>
<p>Of course, there are occasions when it&rsquo;s just not possible to brush. At times like this, whether you have traditional braces or aligners, it&rsquo;s a good idea to rinse well with water after meals or snacks, and brush as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Start your new dental routine now, and soon it will be automatic. An everyday habit. Your new comfort zone. After all, taking a few extra minutes from your day to brush after every meal will be well worth it when you end your orthodontic treatment with a smile that is as healthy as it is beautiful!</p>
