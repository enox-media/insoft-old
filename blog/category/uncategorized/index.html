<p>Well, of course you <em>can</em> chew gum and wear braces. But, <em>should</em> you chew gum and wear braces? That can be a sticky question.</p>
<p>For many years, the answer was a firm &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Not only did our favorite chewables literally gum up the (dental) works, but they were filled with loads of the sugar that cavity-causing bacteria love to feed on. The result? A much better chance of damage to your orthodontic work, and a higher risk of cavities near your brackets and wires.</p>
<p>But times, and gum recipes, change. Today&rsquo;s sugar-free gum provides us with some new ideas to chew over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sugarless gum is much less sticky than regular gum, so it is much less likely to stick to your appliance. If there is any chance that gum will damage your wires or brackets, we&rsquo;ll let you know that it&rsquo;s best to wait until your braces are off to indulge.</li>
<li>Some orthodontic patients find that their jaws and ligaments are less sore if they chew gum for a few minutes after an adjustment.</li>
<li>Most important, studies suggest that chewing sugarless gum might actually help prevent cavities from forming. How is that possible?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because chewing gum increases our production of saliva! Okay, we don&rsquo;t normally find saliva an exciting, exclamation-point-worthy topic, but let&rsquo;s look at the dental benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saliva washes away food particles and bacteria. And because braces can trap food when we eat, it&rsquo;s great to have some help washing away any meal-time souvenirs.</li>
<li>Saliva helps neutralize acids in the mouth. The acids found in foods and produced by oral bacteria lead to cavities, so diluting and neutralizing their effects provide important protection for our enamel.</li>
<li>Saliva helps bathe the teeth in minerals that can actually rebuild weakened enamel. Acids in the mouth attack minerals in the enamel such as the calcium and phosphate that strengthen our teeth. Fortunately, saliva provides calcium, phosphate, and fluoride that can actually help rebuild weakened enamel.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, <em>should</em> you chew gum and wear braces? The real question is, should <em>you</em> chew gum while you&rsquo;re in braces? Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team are more than happy to provide the right answer for you! Talk to us at your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office about the potential benefits and drawbacks of dentist-approved sugarless gum. Depending on the kind of gum you choose and the kind of orthodontic work you are having done, the answer just might surprise you.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all friends here, so if you sometimes feel a bit nervous before your orthodontic appointments, no judging! Ask us about any worries you might have. We are happy to explain procedures, equipment, and your orthodontic options so you know exactly what is going on during treatment. And if X-rays are a concern, we can put your mind at ease here as well.</p>
<p><strong>What Exactly Are X-rays?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes patients feel reluctant about the process of imaging because X-rays are a kind of radiation. But the fact is, radiation is all around us. We are exposed to radiation naturally from our soil and water, sun and air, as well as from modern inventions such as cell phones, Wi-Fi, and air travel.</p>
<p>Why is radiation so common? Because matter throughout the universe constantly gives off energy, and the energy that is emitted is called radiation. This radiation takes two forms&mdash;as particles (which we don&rsquo;t need to consider!) and as traveling rays. This second type is known as electromagnetic radiation, created by photons traveling in regular waves at the speed of light.</p>
<p>We are exposed to electromagnetic radiation every day, because, whether we can see them or not, these different wavelengths and frequencies create various forms of light. Radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays are all part of the electromagnetic light spectrum.</p>
<p>Different types of radiation on this spectrum have different wavelengths and different frequencies, and produce different amounts of energy. Longer wavelengths mean lower frequencies and less energy. Because X-rays have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than, for example, radio waves and visible light, they have more energy.</p>
<p><strong>How Do Dental X-rays Work?</strong></p>
<p>An X-ray machine produces a very narrow beam of X-ray photons. This beam passes through the body and captures images of our teeth and jaws on special film or digital sensors inside the mouth (intraoral X-rays), or on film or sensors located outside the mouth (extraoral X-rays). These X-ray images are also known as radiographs.</p>
<p>Why are X-rays able to take pictures inside our bodies? Remember that higher energy we talked about earlier? This energy enables X-rays to pass through the softer, less dense parts of our bodies, which are seen as gray background in a radiograph. But some substances in our bodies absorb X-rays, such as the calcium found in our bones and teeth. This is why they show up as sharp white images in radiographs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many different types of dental X-rays used in orthodontics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occlusal X-rays, which show the entire arch of teeth in the upper or lower jaw.</li>
<li>Panoramic X-rays, which use a special machine to rotate around the head to create a complete two-dimensional picture of teeth and jaws.</li>
<li><strong>Cephalometric X-rays, which show the patient&rsquo;s entire profile, and the position and development of the teeth and jaws.</strong></li>
<li>Cone Beam Computed Tomography, an external device which uses digital images to create a three-dimensional picture of the teeth and jaws.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Do We Need X-rays?</strong></p>
<p>You might have noticed that these X-rays, unlike, for example, typical bitewing X-rays, don&rsquo;t take images of individual teeth. That is because orthodontists deal with the teeth in relationship to each other and to the structures around them.</p>
<p>Beautifully aligned teeth and a healthy bite are the visible result of your orthodontic work, but there&rsquo;s a lot going on above and below the surface that needs to be discovered and taken into account before your treatment even begins. X-rays help us evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size, shape, and position of your teeth, including impacted teeth and wisdom teeth</li>
<li>The size, position, and health of your roots throughout treatment</li>
<li>The size and shape of your jaw bones, and how they affect your teeth alignment and bite</li>
<li>Your progress during different phases of treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Do Orthodontists Make Sure Your X-rays Are As Safe As They Can Be?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the amount of radiation you are exposed to with a dental X-ray is very small. In fact, a typical panoramic X-ray provides roughly the same amount of radiation we are exposed to through our natural surroundings in just one day. Even so, Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team are committed to making sure patients are exposed to as little radiation as possible.</p>
<p>Radiologists, the physicians who specialize in imaging procedures and diagnoses, recommend that all dentists and doctors follow the safety principal known as ALARA: &ldquo;As Low As Reasonably Achievable.&rdquo; This means using the lowest X-ray exposure necessary to achieve precise diagnostic results for all dental and medical patients.</p>
<p>The guidelines recommended for X-rays and other imaging have been designed to make sure all patients have the safest experience possible whenever they visit the dentist or the doctor. We ensure that imaging is safe and effective in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We take X-rays only when they are necessary.</li>
<li>We provide protective gear, such as apron shields and thyroid collars, whenever needed.</li>
<li>We make use of modern X-ray equipment, for both traditional X-rays and digital X-rays, which exposes patients to a lower amount of radiation than ever before.</li>
<li>When treating children, we set exposure times based on each child&rsquo;s size and age.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now that we&rsquo;ve talked about some things you might like to know,</p>
<p><strong>Please Let <em>Us</em> Know If . . .</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You are changing orthodontists and have had previous orthodontic X-rays taken. Ask to have your older X-rays sent to our office so we have a complete record of your orthodontic history. (With digital X-ray technology, this transfer can be accomplished with e-mail!)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re pregnant, or think you might be pregnant. Even though radiation exposure is very low with dental radiographs, unless there is a dental emergency, dentists and doctors recommend against X-rays for pregnant patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>X-rays play an important part in helping us make sure your orthodontic treatment provides you with a lifetime of beautiful and healthy smiles. If you have any concerns, contact our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. When it comes to making sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with all of our procedures, including any X-rays that might be necessary, we&rsquo;re happy to give you all the inside information!</p>

<p>When does an underbite need surgery? The short answer is: when Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team recommend surgery as the best way to give you a healthy, functional bite. But let&rsquo;s take a longer look, and see just why your doctors might come to that conclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, what exactly <em>is </em>an underbite?</li>
</ul>
<p>In a perfect bite, the upper and lower jaws align, well, perfectly. Upper teeth overlap lower teeth very slightly, upper and lower teeth meet comfortably, and jawbones and joints function smoothly. When the alignment is off, it causes a malocclusion, or &ldquo;bad bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we talk about an underbite, or Class 3 malocclusion, it means that the lower jaw protrudes further than the upper jaw. This protrusion causes the bottom teeth and jaw to overlap the upper teeth and jaw.</p>
<ul>
<li>What causes an underbite?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes an underbite is caused by childhood behaviors while the teeth and jaw are developing, including tongue thrusting or prolonged thumb-sucking and pacifier use. (Working to stop these behaviors before they affect tooth and jaw formation is one of the many good reasons children should have regular visits with their dentists and pediatricians.)</p>
<p>Most underbites are genetic, however, and tend to run in families. It&rsquo;s estimated that from five to ten percent of the population has some form of underbite. The lower jawbone (mandible) might be overdeveloped, the upper jawbone (maxilla) might be underdeveloped, both bones could be affected, or, sometimes, tooth size and placement might cause an underbite. These irregularities in jaw shape and size and/or tooth crowding are not something that can be prevented, and require professional treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why? What&rsquo;s the problem with an underbite?</li>
</ul>
<p>Even a minor underbite can cause difficulties with biting and chewing. A more severe underbite can lead to speech problems, decay and loss of enamel where the teeth overlap, mouth breathing and sleep apnea, persistent jaw and temporomandibular joint pain, and self-confidence issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t my dentist treat my underbite?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most probably not. A <em>very</em> mild underbite can be camouflaged cosmetically with veneers, but this does not address the cause of the underbite, and will not work for moderate or severe underbites.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can my orthodontist treat my underbite?</li>
</ul>
<p>Drs. Insoft and Hurst will create an underbite treatment plan after a detailed study of each patient&rsquo;s individual dental and skeletal structure. Treatment options will vary depending on the cause of the underbite, its severity, and even the patient&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>Early intervention is especially important for children who show signs of an underbite. That&rsquo;s why we recommend that children visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office by the age of seven.</p>
<p>If an underbite is caused by tooth misalignment or crowding, braces can reposition the lower teeth. Sometimes extractions are necessary to make room for proper alignment.</p>
<p>If the cause is due to jaw structure, children&rsquo;s bones are still forming, so treatment can actually help correct bone development. Palatal expanders, headgear, and other appliances are various methods of encouraging and guiding bone development.</p>
<p>But braces and appliances aren&rsquo;t effective for every patient with an underbite, and especially in patients (usually those in their late teens and older) when the jawbones are already fully formed. In this case, we might suggest coordinating treatment with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does an oral and maxillofacial surgeon do?</li>
</ul>
<p>An oral surgeon has the training, experience, and skill to help correct an underbite by surgically reshaping and repositioning the jawbone. This corrective jaw surgery is called orthognathic surgery.</p>
<ul>
<li>What will happen during orthognathic surgery?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your treatment will be tailored to your specific needs. Two of the common surgical procedures for treating an underbite involve repositioning the upper jaw to lengthen it and/or reshaping the lower jaw to shorten it.</p>
<p>Bone is sometimes removed or added, small bone plates or screws are sometimes used to stabilize the bone after surgery&mdash;your surgeon will let you know exactly which procedures will give you a healthy, functional bite. The surgery itself is most often performed under general anesthesia and requires a brief stay in the hospital.</p>
<ul>
<li>How will my orthodontist and oral surgeon coordinate my treatment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Correcting a Class 3 malocclusion can take time. Your oral surgeon will work together with Drs. Insoft and Hurst to analyze the interrelationship of teeth, bones, and joints to determine dental and skeletal problems, and will develop the best treatment plan possible to create a healthy alignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, when does an underbite need surgery?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, a minor underbite can be corrected with braces and appliances alone. A serious underbite, however, will often require the specialized skills of both Drs. Insoft and Hurst and an oral surgeon.</p>
<p>And, while it&rsquo;s not the primary purpose of surgery, corrective jaw surgery and orthodontics can also make you happier with your appearance and boost your self-confidence. Achieving a lifetime of beautiful, comfortable, and healthy smiles&mdash;that&rsquo;s the answer to your question.</p>

<p>One of the most common reasons for getting braces is because there&rsquo;s just not enough room for all your teeth to fit next to each other evenly. The result is overlapping and crooked teeth. What&rsquo;s the first step in creating the space you need? Well, that depends on just how much room you need to align your teeth and bite properly.</p>
<p>When there is going to be a serious need for space, there are orthodontic solutions that can help, including palatal expanders, surgical options, and extractions. But if you only need a tiny bit of room so that regular braces will fit properly, we have a tiny solution&mdash;orthodontic spacers!</p>
<p>Why do you need to make space <em>before</em> you get braces? Because Drs. Insoft and Hurst might need to make some room around crowded molars so your braces can be installed properly.</p>
<p>For example, you might need orthodontic bands to anchor your braces. An orthodontic band is a slim, custom-fitted ring of metal which fits snugly around a molar. It is durable, provides a place to attach bands and springs to help correct malocclusions (bite problems), and can securely surround a tooth that might be weak because of a large filling. Spacers can separate crowded teeth just enough to allow a band to be fitted around a molar.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t need bands, sometimes separators are necessary to provide enough space between the teeth for your braces to work effectively. The back teeth tend to move even closer together with braces, and, without adequate space, bite problems, risk of decay, and other difficulties can arise.</p>
<p>And while you might think that some serious equipment is in order to make room between those sturdy molars, the typical spacer, or separator, is actually extremely simple--usually a tiny, round elastic band, often made of rubber. Spacers can be placed between tight teeth in a matter of minutes. Each ring is stretched and positioned between your teeth with a special tool. As it returns to its original shape, the spacer&rsquo;s width provides just enough pressure on the teeth it touches to make a bit of space between them. And a bit of space is usually all you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>What do spacers feel like? For some people, they can be uncomfortable. You might feel soreness, some pressure, or as though a piece of food is stuck between your teeth. Ask us for suggestions on making you more comfortable, whether it&rsquo;s dining on ice cream and cold drinks, eating soft foods, or taking over-the-counter pain relief. Separators are only designed to be in place for a very short period (usually under two weeks), but if they are causing you pain, give us a call.</p>
<p>What do you need to do to help the process along? Actually, it&rsquo;s more what you need <em>not</em> to do. Don&rsquo;t use dental picks or floss on your separators, avoid chewing gum, and take chewy and sticky foods off the menu. And don&rsquo;t be tempted to touch or play with your spacers!</p>
<p>Spacers can create space between the teeth so quickly and efficiently that they often fall out on their own after a few days. If your separators fall out, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call. It could mean that you are ready for your braces, and on the way to a lifetime of healthy, beautiful smiles. And it&rsquo;s a journey that begins with a tiny, springy step.</p>

    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/09/gum_disease_braces.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Gum disease is one of our most common dental diseases, affecting both children and adults. If you are considering getting braces or aligners, make sure your gums are their healthiest before beginning orthodontic treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gingivitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For both younger and older patients, gingivitis (mild gum disease) can be the result of poor brushing and flossing habits. When plaque builds up around the teeth and gums, it irritates delicate gum tissue. The gums become inflamed, and symptoms such as redness, swelling, tenderness, bleeding, and bad breath can result. Usually, your dentist can treat early stages of gingivitis with tips on more efficient brushing and flossing, a professional cleaning, and suggestions for mouth rinses if needed.</p>
<p>Because brushing and flossing with braces can be more difficult, you need to devote special attention to your cleaning routine to prevent gingivitis from developing <em>after</em> you start treatment. Talk to us any time about how to brush and floss most effectively when you wear braces. Drs. Insoft and Hurst can also recommend tools designed especially for braces wearers to get your teeth and gums as clean and plaque-free as possible. If you are a candidate for clear aligners, this option can make it easier to keep your teeth their cleanest. We&rsquo;ll work with you to keep your gums healthy as your orthodontic work takes place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodontitis</li>
</ul>
<p>For older patients, gingivitis, left untreated, can eventually lead to periodontitis (severe gum disease). This chronic infection can lead to the formation of pockets between your gums and teeth that become home to bacteria and infection. Over time, periodontitis can lead to the destruction of gum, ligament, and bone tissue. Left untreated, it can lead to loose teeth and even bone and tooth loss.</p>
<p>Making sure you schedule regular dental exams will allow your dentist or periodontist to detect and treat any signs of periodontitis as early as possible. If you have any of the symptoms of gum disease, it&rsquo;s important to treat the cause of these symptoms as soon as possible to protect your gums, bone, and teeth. Deep cleaning procedures such as scaling and root planing, topical and oral antibiotics, and oral surgeries such as flap surgery or bone and tissue grafting can help reverse the effects of periodontitis.</p>
<p>Because orthodontic treatment involves moving the teeth and re-forming the ligament and bone tissue, which hold them in place, you need healthy periodontal ligaments and bones to begin treatment. If you have suffered shifting teeth or bone loss due to periodontitis, talk to us. We will let you know at your visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office if you are a good candidate for orthodontic work, and which type of appliance is best for your periodontal health.</p>
<p>We are happy to talk to you about the best way to achieve an attractive smile and a healthy bite if gum disease has been a problem in the past. Most important, we want to make sure that your teeth and gums are their healthiest even before you begin orthodontic treatment. Preventing and treating gum disease will provide the foundation you need for a lifetime of beautiful smiles.</p>

  <h3>September 9th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard from parents or older relatives what braces used to be like years ago&mdash;obvious, uncomfortable, hard to clean, and with inevitable tooth extractions to start off the whole lengthy process.</p>
<p>Today, brackets are much smaller and wires are more pliable. You can even choose ceramic brackets or clear aligners for an almost invisible effect. New tools make cleaning your braces easier than ever. And new braces technology means that treatment is often shorter. But what about extractions? Are they still inevitable?</p>
<p>For orthodontists like Drs. Insoft and Hurst, the objective is <em>saving</em> teeth. And modern practices and technology have made this goal more attainable than ever before. There are several ways that modern treatment procedures can help avoid extractions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that children visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for an orthodontic evaluation by age seven. Because a child&rsquo;s jaw is still forming at this age, early intervention can lead to orthodontic treatment that expands the jaw in order to make room for permanent teeth, or starts correcting bite problems before they become more serious.</p>
<ul>
<li>High-Tech Planning</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s technology allows us to map out the progression of your treatment before we begin. Scanners, X-rays, and computer programs help us to design a treatment plan which will accurately predict how best to move your teeth and correct your bite, taking into account the size and development of your teeth and jaw.</p>
<ul>
<li>Surgical Options</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time you reach your late teen years, the jaw bones have stopped growing and it&rsquo;s no longer possible to expand them without surgery. Oral surgery can treat serious jaw problems that impact your teeth and bite, usually as part of a combined treatment plan designed by your orthodontist and your oral surgeon.</p>
<p>Because we always work to keep teeth intact&mdash;using these methods and others&mdash;you can be sure that, if we recommend extraction, it is absolutely necessary. What could make an extraction necessary?</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe overcrowding. Sometimes, there&rsquo;s just not enough room in the jaw for all of your teeth.</li>
<li>A tooth or teeth that prevent us from correcting a problem with your bite.</li>
<li>Wisdom teeth. Usually, orthodontic work takes place before a patient&rsquo;s wisdom teeth start to erupt. If yours do make an appearance before or during treatment, we can adapt our treatment plan accordingly.</li>
<li>An extra tooth. It&rsquo;s rare, but an extra, or supernumerary, tooth sometimes develops, and your jaw is not designed to accommodate extras!</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about every step of your treatment, including extractions. We want you to understand the treatment plan which will give you your best outcome. If we recommend extraction, it is because this decision is the best way to achieve a healthy bite and alignment, creating your beautiful smile&mdash;and protecting it&mdash;for a lifetime.</p>

  <h3>August 26th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/08/veggie_diet.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following a vegetarian or vegan diet, you know that there&rsquo;s much more to living a healthy life than simply avoiding meat products. Making sure your diet includes enough protein, as well as any nutrients that are primarily available in animal products, takes planning, and there&rsquo;s no one-menu-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>Why? Because there&rsquo;s no one menu that will suit all vegetarians. Specific vegetarian diets can allow for many different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vegan&mdash;a plant-based diet which excludes meat, fish, dairy, and egg products</li>
<li>Ovo-vegetarian&mdash;includes eggs as a dietary option, but no dairy</li>
<li>Lacto-vegetarian&mdash; includes dairy as a dietary option, but no eggs</li>
<li>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian&mdash;a meat-free diet which allows both dairy products and eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a pescatarian, who eats fish on occasion, or a flexitarian, who sometimes includes meat in a meal, your menu options are even broader.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at the big picture&mdash;a healthy vegetarian diet is really more concerned with the foods you <em>do</em> eat for nutrition rather than the foods you <em>don&rsquo;t</em>. You can create a meal plan rich in all your essential nutrients with a little research, no matter which type of vegetarian diet is your go-to choice.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re constructing your ideal menu guidelines, don&rsquo;t forget about your dental nutrition!</p>
<p>In terms of keeping your teeth and gums their healthiest, what important vitamins and minerals are often missing from vegetarian and vegan diets? Let&rsquo;s look at three of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calcium</li>
</ul>
<p>Calcium is essential for maintaining strong bones and tooth enamel. Without enough calcium, a weakened jawbone leads to loose, and even lost, teeth. The acids in our food and the acids created by oral bacteria also weaken the minerals in enamel, including calcium. These weak spots can eventually become cavities. A diet rich in calcium not only supports the bones holding our teeth, but can even help repair, or remineralize, enamel which has been weakened by acidic erosion.</p>
<p>For vegetarians who include dairy in their diets, dairy products are a great way to include calcium. Milk, cheese, and yogurt are traditional and rich sources of this mineral.</p>
<p>For vegans, it&rsquo;s a bit more challenging, but still doable! Non-dairy foods providing calcium include dark green vegetables (kale, broccoli, spinach), certain types of tofu, and fortified cereals, juices, and non-dairy milks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to put that calcium to work by making sure you have enough vitamin D in your diet. Vitamin D not only helps keep our bones healthy, it also enables our bodies to absorb calcium. Bonus&mdash;it&rsquo;s been linked to better gum health in several studies.</p>
<p>So how to get more vitamin D? If you eat dairy, most dairy products have been fortified with vitamin D. If eggs are a part of your diet, egg yolks are a great source. Pescatarians can enjoy the benefits of vitamin D from fatty fish such as tuna and salmon.</p>
<p>Because we get most of our vitamin D from sun exposure or foods derived from animals, plant-based foods are not a practical way to obtain the vitamin D you need. But, just as non-vegetarians can get plentiful vitamin D from fortified dairy products, vegans also have options. Try adding cereals, juices, and non-dairy milks fortified with this essential nutrient to your diet, or take a vegan vitamin D supplement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B12</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitamin B12 is essential for healthy red blood cells, nerve cell development, brain function, and DNA production. (This is why it&rsquo;s especially important for pregnant and nursing women.) Vitamin B12 can also impact your oral health. A B12 deficiency can cause a swollen, sore, or inflamed tongue, loss of taste, and gum, tongue, and mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, vitamin B12 is reliably found only in animal foods and nutritional yeasts. If you would prefer an egg-free and dairy-free diet, look to B12 supplements or B12-fortified cereals, plant-based milks, energy bars, and other vegan options. This is a good subject to discuss with your physician, because even supplements and fortified foods might not provide enough B12.</p>
<p>In fact, Drs. Insoft and Hurst can be vital resources when you&rsquo;re planning your healthiest vegetarian diet. The next time you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, ask for recommendations for supplements if you&rsquo;re concerned that diet alone can&rsquo;t provide for all of your nutrition essentials. Finally, care should be taken to ensure that, even with supplements, you get the proper amount of the vitamins and minerals you need.</p>
<p>As a vegetarian, you are used to the concept of care. Whether it was concern for nutrition, the planet, the animal world, or another reason that drew you to a vegetarian diet, be sure to care for your body as well as your dietary choices. Careful planning can ensure a diet which supports not only your general health, but your oral health, for a lifetime of nourishing&mdash;and well-nourished&mdash;smiles.</p>

  <h3>August 19th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/08/theres_an_app_for_that.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Modern orthodontic technology has led to major changes in the world of braces. Brackets are smaller and come in both metal and ceramic materials. Wires are more efficient and more comfortable. Elastic bands come in a variety of vivid colors, or you can choose brackets which work without bands. You can even decide on clear aligners, with no brackets or wires at all.</p>
<p>And since modern software technology has given us a program for just about everything, it&rsquo;s no surprise that you can install apps to help make your modern orthodontic treatment more convenient and more enjoyable. What can an orthodontic app do for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Track of Your <em>App</em>ointments</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many apps out there that are designed to help you keep your treatment on track with appointment reminders. This sounds pretty basic, but when you have school, work, sports, and activities filling your days, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get a timely reminder that our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office will be expecting you in the near future. And, since missed appointments delay your progress, you are making sure you achieve your beautiful, healthy smile in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<ul>
<li>M<em>app</em>ing Out Your Routine</li>
</ul>
<p>You know how important it is to keep track of the hours you wear your aligners. Apps can help remove the guesswork with a timer to make sure you&rsquo;ve got the hours you need to progress to the next phase of treatment. Apps can also remind you when you&rsquo;re ready for a new aligner, and let you track your progress in one convenient place with selfies after each aligner transition. After all, it&rsquo;s really exciting to see just how far you&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>If you wear traditional braces, there are apps with very helpful reminders for you, too. For example, forgetting to wear your elastics can really delay your progress. An app can let you know when it&rsquo;s time to wear your rubber bands and keep track of your hours. It can also remind you to replace your bands regularly, because elastics become less elastic through the day. And take advantage of the countdown feature some apps offer to see just when you can expect to be done with your treatment when you keep on top of your routine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing and Flossing? <em>App</em>ly Yourself!</li>
</ul>
<p>A big part of making your smile look its best after your orthodontic treatment is making sure you take care of your smile <em>during</em> your treatment. This means keeping up with daily brushing and flossing, and using proper technique. Two minutes brushing, twice each day, and flossing at least once a day are the basic recommendations for preventing cavities and gum disease. (During orthodontic treatment, you might need to increase your brushing and flossing&mdash;ask us how often is best for your needs.)</p>
<p>And to help you make sure you get a solid two minutes of brushing twice a day? Try an app that plays two minutes of your favorite music with a perfectly timed brushing playlist. Apps can also send you brushing and flossing reminders, let you know when it&rsquo;s time to change your toothbrush (every three months, please!), and give you tips on better brushing and flossing techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have Fun with Your <em>App</em>earance</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure just how you&rsquo;ll look in braces? Get a preview with an app that uses one of your selfies to model different types and styles of braces, brackets, bands, and aligners. Metal brackets? Ceramic? Elastic bands in your favorite colors? No bands at all? Hardly visible aligners? Find the look that works for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>When Problems H<em>app</em>en</li>
</ul>
<p>Some apps will even guide you through common orthodontic problems, such as applying wax to an irritating bracket or relieving discomfort. Always remember, though, an app is not an orthodontist. If you have a serious problem or concern, call us immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodontist <em>App</em>roved</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve checked out the orthodontic apps available for your operating system, you know that there are a lot of options out there. If you&rsquo;re looking for an app providing information about your treatment, tips for dealing with your braces, or a convenient way to track your progress or even be part of a community, you want the best information, tips, and conveniences possible&mdash;and hopefully all in one place.</p>
<p>To help you find the best orthodontic app for you, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst! We might know just the app for your specific needs. Whether you choose aligners or brackets and wires, consider all the wire<em>less</em> options that can make your life easier, your dental care more complete, and&mdash;just maybe&mdash;your orthodontic experience a little more fun.</p>

<p>Your dashboard lights up when your car needs an oil change. Your family smoke detector beeps when you need to switch out the batteries. But when it&rsquo;s time to replace your toothbrush, you&rsquo;re on your own. Luckily, there are several not-too-subtle clues that you should be shopping for a new model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraying</li>
</ul>
<p>Is your toothbrush looking a bit scruffy? Do those once orderly bristles look like they have the toothbrush equivalent of bed head? Have some bristles vanished altogether? Time to retire that toothbrush. Once the bristles are frayed, you just can&rsquo;t reach plaque as effectively, especially where it likes to hide between the teeth.</p>
<p>Are you prematurely fraying? You could be brushing too hard. Overbrushing can injure delicate gum tissue, cause wear and tear to tooth enamel, and even damage your braces. If you find your brush fraying after only a few weeks of use, you might be using too much force. Remember, plaque is a sticky film, but it&rsquo;s a soft sticky film. Ask us for advice on just how hard you need&mdash;or don&rsquo;t need&mdash;to brush.</p>
<ul>
<li>Odor</li>
</ul>
<p>This one really goes without saying&mdash;no one wants an aromatic toothbrush! How to make sure your toothbrush is fresh and clean?</p>
<p>Always rinse carefully after you brush. This will get rid of any toothpaste, bits of food, or other particles left on your brush.</p>
<p>Let your toothbrush air dry. It might seem more hygienic to keep your brush covered in a bathroom setting, but a closed, moist container is a perfect breeding ground for germs. Don&rsquo;t let them make a home in your bristles!</p>
<ul>
<li>Illness</li>
</ul>
<p>A cold or a bacterial infection (like strep throat) is no fun. But now that you&rsquo;re feeling better, it might be time to throw out your toothbrush. The chances of re-infection are very low, unless your immune system is compromised, but this is a perfect opportunity to replace your brush with a fresh, germ-free model.</p>
<p>And if you share your toothbrush, or if you store it right next to a family member&rsquo;s (which you really shouldn&rsquo;t do, for this very reason), germs get shared, too. Quarantine your brush while you&rsquo;re ill, and replace it once you&rsquo;re out and about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discomfort</li>
</ul>
<p>Bigger isn&rsquo;t necessarily better. A brush with a head that&rsquo;s too big won&rsquo;t allow you to get into those small spaces in your mouth where plaque likes to collect. And when you are trying to clean around brackets and wires, a regular brush might be a problem. Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst for suggestions for the best tools for clean <em>and</em> comfortable brushing.</p>
<p>Also, harder doesn&rsquo;t mean more effective. A brush with hard bristles can cause damage to your gums and enamel. We almost always recommend soft-bristled brushes for this every reason.</p>
<p>There are so many styles of brush out there, you&rsquo;re bound to find the perfect fit with a little trial and error. Or ask us for suggestions the next time you&rsquo;re at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for an adjustment!</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ve Passed the &ldquo;Best By&rdquo; Date</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of its durable construction, your toothbrush can last a long, long time. But no matter how comfortable and effective your toothbrush is right now, it was never meant to go through life with you. Bristles break down over a period of a few months, and just don&rsquo;t clean as effectively. Your brush should be changed every three months, and this includes changing the head on your electric toothbrush. And because you wear braces, you&rsquo;re brushing more often, so that three month lifespan might be stretching it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t have a flashing light or annoying beep to remind you when it&rsquo;s time to change brushes, so you&rsquo;ll have to devise your own reminders. Reminder apps, calendar notes, the first day of a new season&mdash;use whatever works best for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ignore the clues your toothbrush is leaving you. Replacing your brush whenever it&rsquo;s necessary helps guarantee that the time you spend cleaning your teeth and gums will lead to confident, healthy smiles. Case closed!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk science! From the vastness of the cosmos to sub-atomic particles, science helps us understand the world around us and how it works. So, let&rsquo;s take some familiar scientific fields of study and apply them to your toothbrush.</p>
<p>My toothbrush?</p>
<p>Yes, indeed! When it comes to your oral health, your toothbrush is the first line of defense, so understanding how and why it works so well might help us use this handy tool even more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Biology&mdash;the study of living organisms</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately for your toothbrush, the living organisms we&rsquo;re talking about here are the bacteria which cause tooth decay and those which can lead to illness. How do these problems arise, and how do we prevent them?</p>
<p>Fight Plaque</p>
<p>Plaque is the sticky film that builds up on teeth, and millions of oral bacteria help make up this biofilm. These bacteria convert sugars and other carbohydrates in the foods we eat into acids. And these acids erode our tooth enamel, leading to tooth decay. (More on this when we get to Chemistry.) The best ways to get rid of plaque?</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush often. The recommended minimum is two minutes of brushing twice a day, but when you&rsquo;re having orthodontic work done, it&rsquo;s even more important to banish the plaque that can stick to your braces or inside aligners. Ask us what brushing schedule is best for you.</li>
<li>Try an electric toothbrush. For some people with braces, cleaning the teeth is easier and more thorough with an electric brush.</li>
<li>Replace your brush regularly. Brushes become worn and frayed after three or four months, and you won&rsquo;t be brushing as effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop Germs from Spreading</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t share. Sharing toothbrushes can lead to an increased risk of colds and infections.</li>
<li>Rinse thoroughly after brushing, making sure you remove any toothpaste or debris left after you brush.</li>
<li>Store the brush upright and let it air-dry. Covering the brush or keeping it in a closed container can promote the growth of bacteria more easily.</li>
<li>Keep different brushes separate when they&rsquo;re drying to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
<li>Replace your brush regularly!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chemistry&mdash;the study of what makes up substances, their properties, and how they interact</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to improving your brushing chemistry, the best thing you can do for your toothbrush is to put a dab of fluoride toothpaste on it! Why fluoride? Let&rsquo;s look at the chemistry of tooth enamel.</p>
<p>Tooth enamel is the strongest substance in our bodies&mdash;even stronger than bone. But it is not indestructible, and acidic substances can dissolve the mineral bonds which give our enamel its strength, whether they come from the bacteria in plaque or are found in our favorite foods and drinks (sodas, coffee, tomatoes, and citrus are among the tasty, but acidic, culprits).</p>
<p>The enamel in our teeth contains calcium and phosphate ions, minerals which help make it the strongest substance in our bodies. But when the level of acidity in our mouths becomes too high, these minerals begin to dissolve. Eventually, teeth become pitted, bacteria can penetrate more deeply, and decay is the result.</p>
<p>So what can we do? While our saliva helps neutralize acidity naturally, and we can cut back on acidic foods in our diets, using fluoride toothpaste actually helps restore the strength of our enamel in a process known as &ldquo;remineralization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fluoride works on the surface of enamel to both attract and anchor calcium ions, reducing mineral loss and strengthening the weakened enamel. Fluoride also interacts with the calcium and phosphate compound to create a new compound that is even stronger and more acid-resistant.</p>
<p>When you brush with fluoride toothpaste, you help replace and restore the mineral composition of your enamel&mdash;and there&rsquo;s evidence that fluoride might even interfere with oral bacteria&rsquo;s ability to produce acid. Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> good chemistry!</p>
<p><strong>Physics&mdash;the study of matter and energy and their interactions</strong></p>
<p>The matter here is your tooth enamel, and the energy is the force you use when brushing. And this is one time the force should <em>not</em> be with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-vigorous brushing can not only damage your brackets, but can also irritate delicate gum tissue and wear down enamel. A &ldquo;sawing&rdquo; back-and-forth motion is both hard on your enamel and misses plaque and debris between the teeth. We&rsquo;ll be happy to show you the safest and most effective way to brush with braces. Just remember, &ldquo;Massage, don&rsquo;t scrub.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A soft toothbrush is almost always your best option when you use a manual brush, but if you&rsquo;re still a heavy-handed brusher, or have sensitive teeth and gums, consider an electric model. An electric toothbrush should provide a continuous brushing motion without needing any heavy pressure from the brusher. Some models will even let you know when you are brushing too hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brushing harder is not brushing better, and your teeth, gums, <em>and</em> braces will be heathier with careful brushing habits. If you need tips on brushing with braces, contact our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office and ask!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of science in the simple act of brushing, but we don&rsquo;t need to spend hours studying to get a passing grade in dental health. The things you do normally&mdash;brushing at least two minutes twice a day, using fluoride toothpaste, and applying proper brushing technique&mdash;will help create a smile which will earn you top marks from Drs. Insoft and Hurst for a lifetime!</p>

<p>You devote a lot of energy to your orthodontic treatment. Appointments, rubber bands, adjustments, cleaning (so much cleaning)&mdash;and why? Because you know that your attractive, healthy smile will be well worth the effort.</p>
<p>But if you find that keeping your teeth and braces clean requires more time and energy than it should, and you&rsquo;re still not getting the results you&rsquo;d like, a water flosser might be just the tool you need to help make your cleaning routine easier and more effective.</p>
<p>Plaque and tartar can be a real problem when you wear braces. Cleaning around braces and wires can be a challenge, and it can be difficult to get floss between your teeth and close to your gums, even with special threaders or floss designed to slip behind your wires.</p>
<p>But ignoring bacteria and plaque build-up can lead to cavities, weakened or discolored enamel, and gum problems. Fortunately, a water flosser can help wash away food particles, bacteria, and plaque even in tight, hard-to-reach spaces, while providing gentle cleaning along sensitive gums.</p>
<p>Water flossers use a pulsing stream of water to remove food particles and plaque between and around teeth. You can adjust the water pressure to apply just the right amount of cleaning power, and then direct the flow to your gum line, between your teeth, around your brackets, or anywhere else you need. Some models even offer tapered heads with brushes designed specifically for cleaning braces.</p>
<p>You might consider investing in a water flosser if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobility issues. If you have joint or mobility issues, a water flosser will let you clean those hard-to-reach areas more easily.</li>
<li>Lingual braces. Because lingual braces are on the inside of the teeth, they can be more difficult to clean effectively with regular brushing and flossing.</li>
<li>Problems removing plaque. If you find that you are brushing and flossing regularly, but still have plaque build-up around your braces, give water flossing a try.</li>
</ul>
<p>A beautiful smile is well worth all the time and effort you are devoting to it. If you think a water flosser might save you a bit of that time and effort, and provide better cleaning power, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst&nbsp; about your options during your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. We&rsquo;ll let you know if traditional flossing, a water flosser, or a combination of the two will give you your cleanest, healthiest smile.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got a lot going on in your busy life, and whether it&rsquo;s school, practice, or simply socializing, you want to put a confident face forward. And part of that confidence comes from knowing your breath is its freshest!</p>
<p>Too often, though, this time of your life makes that goal seem difficult. Let&rsquo;s look at ways to keep you smiling your brightest and feeling your freshest in any social setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch Your Diet</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, garlic, onions, and other pungent food choices are obvious culprits when it comes to bad breath, but did you know that sugars and simple carbs are the food of choice for the bacteria that cause decay, gingivitis, and bad breath? Eating a nutritious, braces-friendly diet will help keep your mouth, your braces, <em>and</em> your breath healthy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just what you eat. Dehydration also causes bad breath. But those caffeinated drinks and sodas that keep you going through the day are the source of acids and sugars that contribute to tooth decay, gum disease, and less-than-fresh breath. Water, milk, and healthy smoothies are a great way to stay hydrated, add vitamins and minerals to your diet, and go easy on your braces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Up with Oral Hygiene</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to keep your teeth and gums their cleanest when it seems like you&rsquo;re always on the go, but good oral habits are just as important now as they were when you were younger.</p>
<p>Brushing after every meal and snack and flossing daily will help get rid of the bacteria and plaque, which lead to cavities. Our tongues also harbor the bacteria that cause bad breath, so finish off your routine with a gentle brush of the tongue, or try a tongue scraper.</p>
<p>Flossing helps keep gums healthy, which, in turns, keeps your breath healthy as well. Dentists generally suggest flossing once a day, but wearing braces could require flossing more often to make sure you&rsquo;re getting rid of all those food particles that can become trapped in brackets and wires. Studies have suggested that hormonal changes in teenagers can mean your gums are more at risk for periodontal problems, which can also lead to bad breath, so don&rsquo;t neglect your gum health!</p>
<p>And be sure to make room in your schedule for regular checkups and cleanings. Your dentist and hygienist will let you know if you&rsquo;re on track for healthy teeth and gums and fresh breath.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing Braces?</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of careful brushing and flossing means getting to all those places in your braces which trap food particles. Besides being a source of unpleasant odors, food particles lead to plaque buildup and tooth decay, another cause of bad breath.</p>
<p>Drs. Insoft and Hurst can suggest the best methods for keeping your braces their cleanest&mdash;even in hard to reach spots&mdash;with suggestions for brushing and flossing techniques. We can also suggest the best and easiest-to-use products for your particular braces, and recommend or prescribe antibacterial mouthwashes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing Aligners?</li>
</ul>
<p>Aligners are removed before you eat, so it&rsquo;s easy to forget that they also need attention. Follow instructions given at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for daily cleaning to prevent saliva and plaque from sticking to your aligners and causing odors. And always remember to brush before you replace aligners after eating a meal or even snacking&mdash;otherwise, you&rsquo;re just trapping the food particles that cause cavities or odors next to your teeth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a lot going on in your busy life, and the last thing you need to worry about is fresh breath. Keep up with your solid dental routines, make sure your braces or aligners are clean and plaque-free, and show the world your healthiest, freshest, most confident smile.</p>

<p>No matter how careful you are, accidents can happen. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a slice of apple that was a little bit larger than it should have been. Or you were chewing on your pencil while you were trying to work out an algebra problem. Or you tried a piece of candy that your friend really, truly thought didn&rsquo;t have a caramel center.</p>
<p>No matter the cause, when something&lsquo;s wrong with your braces, you know it. And you want to fix it as soon as possible. What can you do to make yourself more comfortable? And which repairs are best left to orthodontic professionals?</p>
<p>First things first. If you have been injured, and suffered a trauma to your mouth or jaw that has damaged your braces, we want to make sure that you get any medical attention you might need before we worry about your appliance. Call Drs. Insoft and Hurst, and your doctor, immediately if you have suffered a medical or dental injury.</p>
<p>Even if your braces are the only injured party, you might need a special appointment if the damage is something that shouldn&rsquo;t wait and can delay your orthodontic progress. Broken wires, brackets that have fallen off, and loose orthodontic bands, for example, need to be replaced in our office.</p>
<p>But what about minor problems? First, call us to see if it&rsquo;s something that really <em>is</em> minor, and whether you can do some home repairs to keep you going until your next regular visit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wayward Wires</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most common&mdash;and most annoying&mdash;problems is a broken or out-of-place wire. If a wire end is poking you, dental wax can be applied to the loose end to protect your cheeks and gums. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, we can let you know how to apply gentle pressure to move the wire away from delicate tissue. Don&rsquo;t try to cut a broken wire or remove it without talking to us&mdash;small pieces can be swallowed accidentally. We&rsquo;ll give you suggestions for how to handle a broken or loose wire and protect your mouth until you can see us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakaway Brackets</li>
</ul>
<p>If your bracket becomes loose, this is another good reason to give us a call. Brackets are specifically placed to let your archwire guide your teeth where they need to be. Without a firmly bonded bracket, the wire isn&rsquo;t doing you much good! If a loose bracket is irritating your cheeks or gums, you can try a bit of dental wax to stick it in place and cover hard edges until we can re-bond it. If the bracket comes off all together, bring it with you to your next appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balky Bands</li>
</ul>
<p>Spacers are little rubber bands we put between your teeth if we need to create some room between your molars before you get your braces. They have a tendency to fall out after several days. We&rsquo;ll let you know if their work is done, and you&rsquo;re ready to start your orthodontic treatment. If you lose one of your ligatures, those colorful bands around your brackets, give us a call and we&rsquo;ll let you know if replacement can wait.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re happy to help you with any braces problems, large or small. It&rsquo;s best to check with us for even small fixes to make sure you avoid injury. Larger repairs can be handled in our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office&mdash;and we can give you tips on how to prevent future ones. Accidents happen, but they don&rsquo;t need to delay your progress toward a beautiful, healthy smile.</p>

  <h2><a href="../../2020/06/just-what-is-plaque.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Just What Is Plaque?">Just What Is Plaque?</a></h2>
  <h3>June 24th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/06/what_is_plaque.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>From the time you were small, you&rsquo;ve been warned about the dangers of plaque. Why? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s an unpleasant film that sticks to your teeth</li>
<li>It causes cavities</li>
<li>It causes gum disease</li>
<li>It can cause extra problems when you wear braces</li>
</ul>
<p>And really, do we need to know much more than this to motivate us to brush? But if you&rsquo;re in a curious mood, you might be wondering just how this soft, fuzzy film accomplishes all that damage. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the sticky problem of plaque.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque form?</strong></p>
<p>We live with hundreds of species of oral bacteria, most of which are harmless, and some of which are actually beneficial. But when our oral ecosystem gets out of balance, problems can occur. For example, without regular and thorough brushing and flossing, we start to build up plaque.</p>
<p>Plaque starts forming within hours of your last brushing. And even though plaque fits the very definition of &ldquo;seems to appear overnight,&rdquo; this biofilm is actually a complex microbial community with several different stages of development.</p>
<ul>
<li>It starts with saliva.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saliva is vital to our oral health, because it keeps us hydrated, washes away food particles, neutralizes acids in the mouth, and provides minerals which keep our enamel strong. Saliva also contains proteins, which help form a healthy, protective film on the tooth surface. This film is called a pellicle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria attach to the pellicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are species of oral bacteria that are able to attach themselves to the pellicle film within hours of its formation. As they become more firmly attached, they begin to grow and divide to form colonies, and are known as the early colonizers of the plaque biofilm.</p>
<ul>
<li>A complex biofilm forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve skipped brushing for a few days (please don&rsquo;t!), you&rsquo;ll notice a fuzzy, sometimes discolored film on your enamel&mdash;that&rsquo;s a thriving plaque community, and it only takes a matter of days to go from invisible to unpleasant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not removing plaque regularly, it can harden further and become tartar. And once you have tartar buildup, you&rsquo;ll need the care of a dental professional to remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if we ignore plaque and tartar?</li>
</ul>
<p>We get cavities and gum disease.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque cause cavities?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bacteria in plaque, like all organisms, need nutrients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our normal oral environment and the food in our everyday diets provide the nutrients plaque needs. And, as we mentioned above, certain types of oral bacteria convert these nutrients into acids. Foods such as carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are most easily converted into acids, which is why we recommend that you enjoy them in moderation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biofilm promotes acid production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the plaque film, anaerobic bacteria (bacteria which don&rsquo;t use oxygen) convert sugars and starches into acids. As the plaque film becomes denser, it blocks acid-neutralizing saliva and oxygen from reaching these bacteria close to the tooth&rsquo;s surface, creating an ideal environment for the bacteria to produce their acid waste products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acids attack enamel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sticky nature of plaque keeps these acids in contact with tooth enamel, where, over time, acids dissolve minerals in enamel, weakening the mineral structure of the tooth.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque cause gum disease?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria cause inflammation and gingivitis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bacteria in plaque irritate the delicate tissue of the gums, which causes an inflammation response which can leave your gums swollen, red, bleeding, or tender. This early form of gum disease is gingivitis. Fortunately, good dental care and careful brushing and flossing can usually prevent and even eliminate gingivitis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque and tartar can lead to periodontitis.</li>
</ul>
<p>When plaque and tartar build up around and below the gumline, the gums pull away from the teeth, leaving pockets where bacteria collect, leading to infection as well as inflammation. Infections and constant inflammation not only harm gum tissue, they can destroy the bone supporting the teeth. This serious gum condition is periodontitis, and should be treated immediately to avoid further infection and even tooth loss.</p>
<p><strong>How does plaque affect orthodontic patients?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque collects around your braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Braces provide plenty of spots for plaque to hide from your brush. If you aren&rsquo;t extremely diligent with your brushing and flossing, plaque collects near brackets, wires, and bands&mdash;all those spots that a brush and floss find difficult to reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plaque promotes demineralization</li>
</ul>
<p>The demineralization process we mentioned above can cause white spots on teeth (decalcification), where minerals have dissolved. Sometimes these spots can be treated, and sometimes they are permanent. They can become quite sensitive, and may lead to cavities.</p>
<p>Careful brushing and flossing around your braces will help eliminate the plaque that can cause demineralization near brackets. Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the tools and the brushing and flossing techniques which will give you the best results.</p>
<p><strong>How do we fight plaque?</strong></p>
<p>From the time you were small, you&rsquo;ve learned how to fight plaque:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush at least twice a day for two minutes, and be sure to brush all of your tooth surfaces and around the gumline.</li>
<li>Floss to remove plaque from between the teeth and near the gumline.</li>
<li>See your dentist as recommended for a thorough professional cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be proactive. If you have any questions, talk to us at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office about the best way to keep plaque at bay. We can show you the most effective ways to brush and floss, recommend anti-plaque toothpastes and rinses, even suggest plaque-revealing tablets if you&rsquo;re missing some trouble spots.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only brushed up on some plaque basics, because there is a lot more to discover about this complex biofilm. Happily, even with all there is to learn about plaque&rsquo;s growth and development, it&rsquo;s reassuring to know that getting <em>rid</em> of it is quite simple&mdash;with just a soft-bristled brush, some dental floss, and a few minutes of your time each day, you&rsquo;re on the way to a healthy, happy, plaque-free smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be chewing sugary, sticky gum while I&rsquo;m wearing my braces.&rdquo; Or perhaps, &ldquo;I should check with my orthodontist to see if this sugar-free gum is safe for my braces.&rdquo; And these are both great thoughts&mdash;but today, we&rsquo;re thinking about gums of a different sort!</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;ve been taking care of your teeth with regular brushing and flossing, you&rsquo;ve also been taking care of your gums. And now that you&rsquo;re wearing braces, your gums need a bit of special attention to keep them their healthiest.</p>
<p>We tend to think of gum disease as an adult problem. In fact, periodontitis, or serious gum disease, is one of the most common chronic infections in the adult population. But young gums need care, too! Gingivitis, a milder form of gum disease, is unfortunately a common problem for both children and adults.</p>
<p>Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by the build-up of plaque and tartar. When plaque builds up, it irritates delicate gum tissue. And while gingivitis is not as serious as periodontitis, the symptoms caused by this disease are nothing to smile about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redness</li>
<li>Tenderness and soreness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Bad Breath</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already feeling a little tender or swollen after an adjustment, the added discomfort caused by gingivitis is the last thing you want. But even worse, neglected gingivitis can lead to more serious infections of gum and even bone tissue. Luckily, gingivitis is both preventable and treatable with proper dental care.</p>
<p>So, how to protect your gums? We have some suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing Better with Braces</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be hard to brush around your brackets and wires, but keeping these areas free of food particles and plaque makes for healthy gums&mdash;and fewer cavities! There are specially designed manual toothbrushes made for braces wearers, and tiny interproximal brushes that can reach tight spaces. Or, perhaps an electric toothbrush will do a better job for you. Just be sure to brush after each meal for the most complete removal of bacteria and plaque.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn New Flossing Techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>You might wonder how on earth you&rsquo;ll get in between your teeth with your wires and brackets in the way. We have the answers! We know the best techniques for flossing your specific braces, and we&rsquo;ll recommend specially designed flossing tools to make the job easier. Water flossers can also be a great help for cleaning in tight spots. Be sure to make flossing part of your daily routine&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be able to remove plaque from places brushing just can&rsquo;t reach.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rinsing? Recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the best dental rinses for reducing plaque and tartar, or how gargling can help prevent irritation. And drink water! Water helps wash away plaque and bacteria, and is a great way to rinse teeth and braces if you absolutely can&rsquo;t brush after eating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with Professional Cleanings</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to keep up with your regular dental exams and cleanings. Your dentist or hygienist will be able to remove any plaque or tartar build up that home brushing can&rsquo;t handle.</p>
<p>We want your time in braces to be as healthy&mdash;and comfortable&mdash;as possible. If you have any gum discomfort, swelling, or sensitivity, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call. With prompt action, gingivitis can be treated, and with careful attention to your cleaning routine, gingivitis can be prevented altogether. Something to think about!</p>

<p>Our grandmothers and grandfathers, our moms and dads&mdash;we&rsquo;ve known them our whole lives. So, why are they so hard to shop for?</p>
<p>If your older family members have all the sweaters, socks, and scents they need, consider a gift that can make life a bit easier and perhaps a lot healthier&mdash;an electric toothbrush!</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important reason to choose an electric toothbrush is its effectiveness. Several studies have shown that regular use of an electric toothbrush leads to a marked reduction in plaque, that bacteria-filled film which sticks to the teeth and leads to cavities and gingivitis. And it&rsquo;s really no surprise that an electric brush can out-perform a manual brush.</p>
<p>Using a manual brush is not just a matter of applying toothpaste and scrubbing. Proper technique means short brush strokes at a 45-degree angle for the outer and inner surfaces of the tooth, thoroughly cleaning the uneven chewing surfaces of the molars, and brushing the inside of the front teeth with gentle vertical strokes. Meticulous cleaning of all these surfaces can be difficult, especially for people with dexterity issues.</p>
<p>Electric toothbrushes offer several options, from oscillating/rotating brushes to oscillating/rotating/pulsating models to brushes using sonic vibration technology. What they all have in common is the ability to remove plaque far more effectively than we can on our own, because they provide the equivalent of thousands and even tens of thousands of brushstrokes per minute, as opposed to the hundreds we can achieve by hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable Control</li>
</ul>
<p>An electric toothbrush can be not only more efficient, but also more comfortable for older brushers. For those with arthritis, limited mobility, injuries, or other health conditions, the larger handles can be easier to control and much more grip-friendly. And, with the work being done by the brush head, users avoid repetitive hand and wrist motion.</p>
<p>Also, the pressure applied to teeth and gums with an electric brush is designed to clean thoroughly while protecting the mouth. Heavy-handed manual brushing can irritate delicate gum tissue and even damage enamel over time. With an electric brush, users only need to guide it along teeth and gums as it supplies all the power needed. There are even pressure sensors available to warn users that their brushing is too vigorous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps, Anyone?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your grandfather likes to keep things old school, a basic model with a convenient two-minute timer and several cleaning modes will offer all the bells and whistles he needs. But if your nana has more Instagram followers than you do, consider a more tech-savvy option.</p>
<p>Several of today&rsquo;s electric brushes come with features designed to make brushing even more effective. They can let her know if she&rsquo;s brushing long enough, alert her if she&rsquo;s brushing too hard, and remind her that it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Some models link to handy apps that will map out just where she&rsquo;s brushed, in case there are a few spots that get overlooked. Or choose a model which comes with a travel case that can recharge while she&rsquo;s busy seeing the world.</p>
<p>Okay, all that being said, we&rsquo;ll admit it&mdash;a toothbrush might not be the most glamorous gift your grandparent unwraps on that special day. But helping a favorite family member brush more effectively and comfortably while improving dental health? That&rsquo;s a gift that keeps on giving!</p>

<p><strong>Press Pause</strong></p>
<p>If you are getting braces in the near future, it&rsquo;s very important to see your regular dentist first. That way, any cavities or other dental problems can be treated before your first orthodontic appointment at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</p>
<p><strong>Play it Safe</strong></p>
<p>Once you have your braces, you&rsquo;ll hearing a lot about how you need to be especially careful with your dental hygiene. Why? Because wires and brackets are obstacles to getting your teeth and gum area their cleanest. Plaque and food particles tend to stick to braces, and all too often can be missed while brushing. Plaque builds up around your gum line and brackets, and, in a very short time, can lead to sensitivity, demineralization, and cavities.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do to prevent tooth decay?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase Your Brushing Time</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of brushing twice a day, start brushing for two minutes after every meal. Put together a travel bag with a small toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, and interproximal brushes to clean your teeth when you&rsquo;re on the go. If you absolutely can&rsquo;t brush, rinse carefully with water, and then brush as soon as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flossing&mdash;More Important than Ever</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the flossing tools designed just for braces to make sure you&rsquo;ve removed food particles and plaque from around your braces and gums. A water flosser can be helpful if manual flossing isn&rsquo;t effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Up with Your Regular Dental Care</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule regular checkups and professional cleanings at your dentist&rsquo;s office. They will be able to remove plaque you might miss at home. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow Our Advice</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to brush and floss, what products to use, and diet suggestions (such as keeping sugary and sticky foods off the menu and away from your braces). If we notice plaque building up around your gums and brackets, we&rsquo;ll let you know that you need to step up your hygiene habits. We can also suggest rinses and toothpastes that help fight plaque.</p>
<p>But if, despite all your efforts, you do get a cavity? There are options!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring Your Cavity?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Not</em> an option. You shouldn&rsquo;t wait until you are out of braces to get a cavity treated. This just gives decay a chance to spread further.</p>
<ul>
<li>Working With Your Braces</li>
</ul>
<p>Repairing a cavity means removing the decay in the tooth, cleaning the area, and then filling the tooth. If your cavity isn&rsquo;t located near your bands, brackets, or wires, your dentist might be able to work around your braces, and you can get your cavity treated during a regular dental appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing Parts of Your Braces for Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a cavity is located in a spot that your dentist can&rsquo;t reach because of your braces. In that case, we&rsquo;re able to coordinate with your dentist and remove a wire or bracket temporarily so you can have your tooth filled. Make an appointment to replace your bracket and re-attach your wire, and you&rsquo;ll be back on schedule as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Forward</strong></p>
<p>Keep your eyes on your goal--you&rsquo;re in braces because you want a beautiful smile. Keeping on top of your dental health is an essential part of creating that smile. Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about tips for getting your teeth their cleanest. If you do develop a cavity, we&rsquo;ll help you figure out the best way to treat it without causing too much delay in your orthodontic treatment. Taking care of your teeth now is the best way to create a future of beautiful smiles!</p>

<p>When you get braces as a child, you usually present the orthodontist with a blank canvas&mdash;newly erupted, perfect permanent teeth, just waiting to be aligned. But if you are a bit older, your canvas might already be a bit busy, with fillings, crowns, perhaps even a missing tooth. Can Drs. Insoft and Hurst still work with that more complicated picture? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>Fillings</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of us have acquired a filling or two. Normally, an old filling shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with new braces. Large fillings, however, might call for spacers. These small rubber bands are inserted between two teeth as needed to create enough room for bands and brackets, and are generally put in place a week or two before you get your braces. They frequently fall out on their own as the space between the teeth gets a bit wider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowns</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have had a root canal or any other dental treatment that left you with a crowned tooth, no need to be concerned. A special dental adhesive can be used to adhere brackets to crowns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implants</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have or would like to get an implant, this is a time to coordinate with your orthodontist and dentist or oral surgeon. Sometimes an implant can anchor your appliance, and sometimes it&rsquo;s best to keep the spot open until your orthodontic work is completed. Once in place, an implant will not have the mobility of a tooth, so it&rsquo;s always best to make sure your doctors can create a schedule that will work for both the installation of the implant and the positioning of your braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy Teeth and Gums</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you begin orthodontic work, talk to your dentist. If you need a filling or crown, are considering a dental implant, have symptoms of gum disease, or are looking at any other dental concerns, you should work with your dentist first. Healthy teeth and gums are the very best foundation for orthodontic treatment at <em>any</em> age.</p>
<p>If you are wondering whether Drs. Insoft and Hurst can help you achieve the smile you&rsquo;ve always wanted, talk to us when you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office! Your past dental work will be just one of the many variables we take into consideration when we&rsquo;re planning your future of picture-perfect smiles.</p>

  <h3>May 13th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>Plaque is a sticky subject! It sticks to the enamel of our teeth above and below the gum line, and it collects around braces. Plaque is one of the major causes of tooth decay and gum disease, and our teeth are under daily attack by this filmy menace.</p>
<p>What are the facts about plaque, and how can we fight back? Read on for some effective strategies!</p>
<p><strong>What Is Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Plaque is a sticky film that builds up on our teeth, largely made up of millions of different types of oral bacteria. Plaque is a colorless biofilm at first, but as it collects, it takes on a white or yellow tint. If you haven&rsquo;t brushed for a few days, that fuzziness you feel on your teeth is plaque build-up. Unless it&rsquo;s removed, plaque hardens within a matter of days to become tartar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: You can remove plaque with careful brushing and flossing, but it takes a dental professional to remove tartar. Be proactive!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Does Plaque Cause Cavities?</strong></p>
<p>Bacteria in plaque use our food as their food, especially sugars and carbs. They can then transform these nutrients into acids, which attack our tooth enamel, weakening it and leaving it vulnerable to further erosion and eventual decay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Cavities aren&rsquo;t the only damage caused by accumulated plaque. Plaque also collects along and below the gum line. If tartar forms here, it irritates delicate gum tissue, leading to gingivitis and more serious gum disease. Make sure you don&rsquo;t forget your gums when you brush and floss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Does Plaque Build Up?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer? Plaque is always forming, because oral bacteria are a natural part of our biology. (In fact, there are even oral bacterial which are beneficial.) Plaque starts building up within minutes after eating, and during the night as we sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we recommend brushing for two minutes at least twice a day, and flossing at least once a day. When you wear braces or aligners, brushing more often is a good idea. Food collecting around braces or inside aligners is a feast for plaque! Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst for suggestions for your best brushing schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Just because plaque is unavoidable, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we need to give the bacteria in plaque any additional encouragement. Every time you have a meal or a snack that&rsquo;s heavy in carbs and sugars, you are providing more fuel for acid production. Cutting down on foods like sugary desserts and sodas is not only nutrition-healthy, it&rsquo;s tooth-healthy!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where Does Plaque Collect?</strong></p>
<p>Plaque builds up all over tooth surfaces, at the gum line, and even below the gum line. It&rsquo;s especially easy to miss in hard-to-reach places like the irregular surfaces of molars, between the teeth, behind our front teeth, and near the gum line. Plaque also collects around your braces, and requires special care to make sure your teeth don&rsquo;t suffer cavities or the white spots caused by demineralization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: One of the ways plaque avoids detection is its invisibility. Fortunately, if you&rsquo;re having trouble brushing away all your plaque, there are plaque-disclosing toothpastes and chewable tablets available in the dental aisle which reveal the plaque hiding between, behind, or around your teeth by tinting it with a can&rsquo;t-miss color. Just brush the color away, and you&rsquo;ve brushed the plaque away as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Do We Clean Away Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Use the Right Tools</p>
<p>Floss at least once a day. There are different materials, sizes, and coatings for floss, so you can find one that&rsquo;s comfortable for you. Floss reaches those spots in between teeth and around the gum line that brushes miss.</p>
<p>Choose a soft toothbrush (soft bristles are better for your enamel) and change it every three to four months, or as soon as the bristles show wear. Make sure the head is the right size&mdash;too big, and it&rsquo;s not only uncomfortable, but you won&rsquo;t be able to reach all the surfaces you need to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tips: There are special dental flosses created just for your braces. You can also use interproximal brushes water flosser to clean around wires and brackets. If you have trouble removing plaque around your teeth and braces with a manual toothbrush, consider an electric model. Several studies have shown a reduction in plaque with the use of an electric brush.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Right Toothpaste</p>
<p>There are many toothpastes specifically formulated to fight plaque and tartar. And fluoride toothpastes not only fight cavities, they can strengthen your enamel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: Studies have shown that toothpastes with baking soda, in particular, are effective in reducing plaque. Ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst for a recommendation the next time you&rsquo;re at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the Right Technique</p>
<p>What not to do?&nbsp; A forceful, horizontal sawing motion is awkward, hard on your enamel, and misses plaque and debris between the teeth. Technique is important&mdash;not for style points, but for cleaner teeth!</p>
<p>Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle, especially at the gum line, to gently remove plaque from teeth and gums. Use short strokes or a circular motion to clean as much of the surface and between the teeth as possible. Brush the inside of your front teeth with careful vertical strokes&mdash;remember, that&rsquo;s one place where plaque is easy to overlook. The same holds true for the tops of your molars, so thoroughly clean those uneven surfaces.</p>
<p>If you wear braces, be sure to clean thoroughly around brackets and wires, where plaque can accumulate quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: If you wear clear aligners, don&rsquo;t forget to give them a gentle brushing as well! Plaque can stick to aligners, causing discoloration and odors, so follow our cleaning instructions carefully.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who Can Help You Fight Plaque?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you do your best at home, plaque can still be a sticky problem. That&rsquo;s why we advise regular professional cleanings, which not only remove any plaque that&rsquo;s hiding away, but also eliminate any built-up tartar around your braces. And, of course, there you can learn all about how to keep your teeth their cleanest.</p>
<p>True, you&rsquo;re fighting plaque every day, but you have all the tools you need to make sure your teeth and gums stay healthy. You&rsquo;re winning the battle with plaque every time you eat a nutritious meal, and every time you brush and floss. With that kind of strategy, plaque doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance. And your bright smile and healthy teeth and gums? That&rsquo;s a victory worth celebrating!</p>

  <h2><a href="../../2020/05/how-often-should-you-brush.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to How Often Should You Brush?">How Often Should You Brush?</a></h2>
  <h3>May 6th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following your dentist&rsquo;s advice, you know that you should be devoting two minutes twice a day to gentle, thorough brushing, and floss carefully at least once a day. It&rsquo;s automatic. It&rsquo;s habit. You&rsquo;re in the zone. Now that you have braces or aligners, though, it&rsquo;s time to step up your game!</p>
<p><strong>Removing Food Particles</strong></p>
<p>No one wants to worry about food particles stuck in braces right after lunch&mdash;or, worse, noticed hours after lunch! Because food tends to stick around brackets and wires, Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL team recommend brushing after a meal. Not only will you be confident in your smile, you&rsquo;ll be improving your dental health.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p><strong>Better Plaque Removal</strong></p>
<p>Plaque is a sticky film containing acid-producing bacteria. These acids lead to weakened enamel and, eventually, cavities. Careful brushing with a fluoride toothpaste helps eliminate plaque. But as you may have discovered, it can be more difficult to clean around brackets and wires. Brushing after eating will help keep plaque from forming on your enamel, and using the right tools (floss made for braces and interproximal brushes) will help clean plaque more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>But what about aligners?</strong></p>
<p>If you wear clear aligners, you take them out when you eat. This avoids the problem of food particles trapped in brackets and difficulty brushing around wires. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean you are home free. Brushing after every meal is also a good idea when you wear aligners.</p>
<p>Our teeth have an organic way to help remove food particles, acids, and bacteria between brushings&mdash;saliva! Your aligners, while covering your teeth, decrease their exposure to saliva. It&rsquo;s really important, then, to make sure you brush after eating. Otherwise, food particles and acids can remain on your teeth after you replace your aligners, increasing the risk of enamel erosion and decay.</p>
<p>Brushing helps keep your aligners clear as well. If you notice aligner discoloration, this could be the result of food residue such as tomato sauce or coffee that remained on the teeth after a meal. Anything that stains your enamel can stain your aligners. And don&rsquo;t forget about plaque. Plaque can stick not only to your enamel but to your aligners as well. If you notice that your aligners are cloudy, or have an unpleasant odor, talk to us about the best way to keep them their cleanest.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Plan</strong></p>
<p>So, what can you do to make brushing more convenient during a busy day? Be prepared! Keep a small kit with you containing a travel brush, a small tube of toothpaste, floss, and an interproximal brush for quick cleanings when you&rsquo;re out and about, and you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about your smile.</p>
<p>Of course, there are occasions when it&rsquo;s just not possible to brush. At times like this, whether you have traditional braces or aligners, it&rsquo;s a good idea to rinse well with water after meals or snacks, and brush as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Start your new dental routine now, and soon it will be automatic. An everyday habit. Your new comfort zone. After all, taking a few extra minutes from your day to brush after every meal will be well worth it when you end your orthodontic treatment with a smile that is as healthy as it is beautiful!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about mouthguards.</p>
<p>We could talk about how important wearing a mouthguard is when you lead an active life. If you play sports, ride bikes, skateboard, or participate in many other kinds of exercise, mouthguards protect your teeth, mouth tissue, and jaws from accidents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or we could talk about how wearing a mouthguard while you&rsquo;re wearing braces has extra benefits. Besides its normal protection, your guard helps protect your brackets and wires from damaging contact, and your delicate mouth tissue from impact with your braces.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not going to talk about any of these important topics today. Instead of looking at how your mouthguard protects <em>you</em>, today we&rsquo;re going to look at how you can protect your <em>mouthguard</em>.</p>
<p>If you want your guard to last longer, work better, and stay (and smell!) cleaner, some basic tips make all the difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your guard clean.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can&rsquo;t be stressed enough. Without a good cleaning routine, your guard can become discolored, develop an unpleasant odor, and even cause illness. Not very appealing, right? Happily, keeping your mouthguard clean isn&rsquo;t difficult.</p>
<p>When you wear your guard, the same plaque that is present in your mouth makes itself at home in your appliance. And when your guard is in its case, that dark, moist environment makes it a perfect breeding ground for all kinds of bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</p>
<p>As soon as you take your mouthguard out, rinse it off. Brush with a soft toothbrush to remove all the plaque, saliva, or food debris that might be lingering in your appliance. (If you are on the playing field, in the park, or at some other inconvenient location, rinse it and brush as soon as you can.) Toothpaste can help get your guard its cleanest, but can be too abrasive for some appliances.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve cleaned it, let your guard air dry in a clean spot for about 30 minutes. Air drying helps prevent bacterial growth. After your guard has dried, return it to its case.</p>
<p>Once a week, you might need to give your mouthguard a good soak in a mouthwash or other dental cleaning solution.</p>
<p>Since cleaning instructions can be different depending on which type of mouthguard you have, be sure to follow our instructions if you have a custom guard, or clean as directed by the manufacturer if you have a store guard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>When your mouthguard isn&rsquo;t in your mouth, it should be in its case. Floating loose in your locker or tumbling around in your gym bag puts your guard at risk for breakage <em>and</em> bacteria.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to clean your case thoroughly every few days and air dry it as well. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, mold, and other unwelcome guests can collect in your case, too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it only as long as it&rsquo;s in good condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can purchase mouthguards from sporting or drug stores, or Drs. Insoft and Hurst can make you a mouthguard designed to fit your teeth and braces perfectly. These appliances are made to be strong and durable, but they&rsquo;re not indestructible. Over time they can wear down or become damaged, especially if you treat them carelessly.</p>
<p>Bacteria can lurk in dents and cracks, and you can cut your mouth on rough, sharp, or broken edges. But if your mouthguard isn&rsquo;t fitting properly, don&rsquo;t resort to self-help! Trying to repair, reshape, or trim your appliance yourself is not a good idea, because it might affect its fit and protective ability.</p>
<p>Any sign that your guard isn&rsquo;t fitting properly or shows signs of wear and tear could mean it&rsquo;s time for a replacement. You can replace a store model, or see Drs. Insoft and Hurst about replacing or repairing your custom guard. A mouthguard that doesn&rsquo;t fit, doesn&rsquo;t keep you safe.</p>
<p>Take care of your guard, and it will take care of you. The reward for the small amount of time and effort you put into caring for your mouthguard is braces that will last through your treatment at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office and a smile that will last you for a lifetime. Those are benefits we can talk about all day!</p>

<p>You waited for this movie all year. You got your tickets early, and you&rsquo;ve got the best seats in the theater. Whether you paid to see the latest action flick or the most romantic comedy in the history of romcoms, it&rsquo;s not as nearly as much fun if the trip to the snack bar is a horror story. Perhaps Drs. Insoft and Hurst can help!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wearing traditional braces, the usual suspects, chewy, sticky, hard, and crunchy foods, are still off limits even when the lights go down. Let&rsquo;s look at some alternative casting.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Candy Counter</li>
</ul>
<p>Licorice, caramels, taffy, and candy with nuts can make any film a disaster movie&mdash;and can make your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office an emergency one. Stick with soft chocolates, chocolates with creamy fillings, ice cream, and ice cream bars (without nuts or caramel, of course).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Soda Fountain</li>
</ul>
<p>Sodas won&rsquo;t break your braces, but they will damage your teeth, so try to brush as soon as you can or rinse with water after enjoying one of those titanic servings. And no crunching on ice! That <em>can</em> damage your braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Popcorn Machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, we can&rsquo;t help you here. Popcorn, with or without that tempting flood of melted butter, is off limits. The kernels can get lodged between your teeth and braces, and can be very hard to remove. They can also cause breakage to wires and brackets.</p>
<p>If you still crave something salty, check with us to see if soft pretzels or baked potato chips might be an option for you.</p>
<p>Movie treats contain a lot of starches and sugars, which stick to braces and feed cavity-causing bacteria, so it&rsquo;s always best to go easy on the snacks. But you don&rsquo;t have to give up the concession counter completely&mdash;just enjoy in moderation and be sure to brush thoroughly when you get home.</p>
<p>And if you wear clear aligners? You can remove your aligners, eat what you like, and clean your teeth carefully before replacing them. But do remember&mdash;you&rsquo;re supposed to wear your aligners for a set number of hours each day. If you&rsquo;re looking forward to a four-hour epic, make sure to take into account your treatment schedule.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if your movie was worth the wait. But we do know that the results of your orthodontic treatment will be! Take care of your teeth and braces, and you&rsquo;ll be on the fastest, healthiest track to an award-winning, red carpet smile.</p>

  <h3>April 15th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/04/missing_tooth_missing_out.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>You&rsquo;ve decided&mdash;now&rsquo;s the time to talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about straighter teeth and a better bite. So what&rsquo;s holding you back? If you are concerned because you have a missing tooth, don&rsquo;t let that stop you from making that first appointment. Orthodontists today have many options to help you achieve the benefits of a more attractive, and even healthier, smile.</p>
<p>How can we accommodate a patient with a missing tooth or teeth? Because each patient is different, our approach will be tailored to your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>A Lost or Missing Permanent Tooth</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of treatment options available, depending on the position of your other teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your teeth are already crowded, it might be possible to close a small gap left by a missing tooth with braces.</li>
<li>If the space between your teeth is the perfect size for a replacement tooth, your orthodontic appliance will keep that spot open as your braces move the rest of the teeth into alignment.</li>
<li>If you need more space for a replacement tooth, braces can help widen the space between your surrounding teeth for an ideal fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooth loss can occur for a number of reasons. Accidents, decay, and gum disease can lead to tooth loss.&nbsp; Congenitally missing teeth, teeth that simple never developed, are also a fairly common condition. But missing teeth are not merely a cosmetic issue, and should not be ignored. A gap in your smile can lead to shifting of the teeth around it, bite problems, difficulty chewing, and gradual loss of bone tissue beneath the missing tooth.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s implants are a permanent, natural-looking replacement for a lost tooth. If you decide that an implant is your best option for tooth replacement, you are still a candidate for orthodontic treatment. Drs. Insoft and Hurst and your oral surgeon can decide on a schedule that will provide the best timing for each phase of your treatment.</p>
<p><strong>A Lost Baby Tooth</strong></p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s not forget younger patients. Sometimes children benefit from orthodontic care before all of their adult teeth have erupted. If your child has lost a baby tooth too early, a space maintainer can be used to prevent shifting and misalignment of the remaining baby teeth and leave room for the adult tooth to erupt in its proper spot.</p>
<p>We recommend that your child have a first orthodontic assessment around age seven, but if your child has lost a primary tooth before its time, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call. We can let you know if a space maintainer is the best way to prevent future dental and orthodontic problems.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about a missing tooth or teeth, talk to us! Orthodontic treatment is always custom-designed to fit the needs of each individual patient. We can discuss your specific goals, and how orthodontic treatment can help you achieve them. There is no reason to let a missing tooth keep you from a more attractive, healthier smile!</p>

  <h3>April 8th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/04/chewing_gum.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Why do you chew gum? Perhaps because it&rsquo;s a habit that comes with some healthy benefits. Chewing a stick or two reduces the urge to snack between meals. It&rsquo;s a substitute for behaviors like nail biting that you&rsquo;d like to change. It might even give you fresher breath after those tuna sandwiches in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>And, as it happens, chewing sugarless gum actually offers a few dental benefits as well! The act of chewing increases saliva production. Saliva washes away food particles, neutralizes acids in the mouth that can damage enamel, and even bathes the teeth in essential minerals that help strengthen weakened enamel. We&rsquo;re talking about sugar-free gum here, of course, because regular gum will just bathe your teeth in sugar&mdash;no one&rsquo;s idea of a dental benefit!</p>
<p>So why not open that pack and enjoy? Because, despite the many positive reasons you can think of for chewing gum, sometimes gum can have a negative impact on your braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sticky Situation</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping your braces clean can be a bit of a challenge. That&rsquo;s why you have special toothbrushes, flosses, and interproximal brushes to get rid of food particles that stick around after you eat. And, while any food can get caught in your braces, sugared gum, because it is so sticky, can stick to appliances much more easily and much more thoroughly than even sugar-free gum. You might be able to remove gum residue with regular brushing and flossing, but, worst case scenario, you might be looking at gum firmly stuck in the brackets or between the brackets and wires.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gumming Up the Works</li>
</ul>
<p>Chewing gum can also affect your treatment time if the action of chewing causes your arch wire to bend. When your wire isn&rsquo;t providing the proper shape or the right amount of tension, your teeth won&rsquo;t get to where they need to be as quickly and efficiently. No piece of gum is worth discovering at your next appointment that you haven&rsquo;t made any progress for weeks due to a damaged wire. And since chewing gum can also lead to loose brackets and bands, you might wonder if this sticky habit is ever worth the trouble it can cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>Something to Chew Over</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you decide, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst! Chewing sugarless gum increases saliva production, which can help wash away food particles from your mouth and your braces. As an added benefit, the action of chewing for a few minutes after an appointment has been shown to reduce the discomfort of an adjustment. Because today&rsquo;s braces are stronger and more durable, and sugarless gum much less likely to stick to them, we can let you know if chewing gum might be acceptable or even desirable depending on your specific treatment plan and your appliance.</p>
<p>Talk to us at your next appointment at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office about gum chewing, and we&rsquo;ll give you the very best recommendations for keeping your teeth healthy, your braces clean, your appliance intact, and your treatment plan on track. Even if gum needs to be off the menu for a while, what you&rsquo;ll get in return&mdash;the best and fastest path to your beautiful smile&mdash;will be well worth it!</p>

  <h3>April 1st, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/04/national_facial_protection_month.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Poor April. While other months celebrate romance, or giving thanks, or costumes and candy, April has&mdash;April Fool&rsquo;s Day and a tax deadline. We might be forgiven for thinking these two dates seem more like warnings than celebrations.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a new topic for the April calendar: National Facial Protection Month! Take the opportunity this month to review your safety practices while you&rsquo;re enjoying your favorite activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouthguards</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a mouthguard for sports or athletic activities, wear it! In any activity or sport where humans come into contact with solid objects (including other humans) tooth injury is possible. A mouthguard will help protect you from dental injuries caused by falls, physical contact, or other accidents that might happen in your active life. And it&rsquo;s not just your teeth&mdash;mouthguards protect your lips, tongue, and jaw as well.</p>
<p>You can buy mouthguards in stock sizes or shape-to-fit models, or you can have a guard made especially for you at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. Custom mouthguards fit perfectly and are designed to make breathing and speaking easy and comfortable. If you wear braces, a custom mouthguard can be designed to protect your smile <em>and</em> your appliance. Just talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst for suggestions!</p>
<p>After all the time and work you&rsquo;ve put into your orthodontic care, don&rsquo;t let a sports injury set you back. What else should you consider for your facial protection?</p>
<ul>
<li>Helmets</li>
</ul>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a helmet available for your sport, use it! Helmets are especially important for protecting athletes from brain injury and concussion, and they help protect the face and jaw as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face Guards</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve experienced a puck speeding toward you, or a defensive tackle hurtling your way, or a fast ball coming in at 90 miles an hour, you know the importance of wearing a face guard. These guards can help protect your eyes, face, teeth, and jaws. Many sports now recommend using face guards&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth checking to see if your sport is one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eye Protection</li>
</ul>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget eye protection. Whether it&rsquo;s safety glasses or a visor, protecting your eyes and the bones around them is extremely important. You can even get sports goggles or protective sports glasses with prescription lenses to keep you safe and seeing clearly.</p>
<p>So here are a few suggestions for your calendar this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven&rsquo;t gotten a mouthguard yet, now&rsquo;s the time. Tooth and mouth injuries occur in sports beyond hockey and football. If you play basketball, ski, skateboard, ride a bike&mdash;in fact, almost any sport where you can fall or make contact with a person or object&mdash;a mouthguard is a must.</li>
<li>If you need to replace an ill-fitting or damaged helmet and face guard, do it before your next game. And do replace a bike helmet if you&rsquo;ve been in a crash&mdash;most likely it won&rsquo;t be as protective, even if damage isn&rsquo;t visible.</li>
<li>Talk to your eye doctor about protective eyewear if off-the-rack products don&rsquo;t work for you.</li>
<li>If you are a parent or caregiver, make sure your child athlete has the proper facial protection&mdash;and uses it.</li>
<li>If you are a coach, make sure your athletes have the right protective gear&mdash;and wear it.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also a great time to commit to using your protective gear <em>every single time</em> you&rsquo;re active.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, wait&mdash;these reminders are helpful and important, but weren&rsquo;t we promised something to celebrate this April? Good catch! The great news is, using facial protection for sports and athletic activities gives you rewards you can celebrate all year: fewer injuries, fewer visits to the emergency room, and a beautiful, healthy, intact smile. Suit up!</p>

  <h3>February 19th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/02/tips_braces_clean.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Orthodontic technology changes and improves all the time. Today&rsquo;s braces are lighter, smaller, and more efficient than those of past years. Wires are thinner and more flexible. Even brackets come in different styles and colors. These developments are all great news for braces wearers. Unfortunately, there is one advancement we haven&rsquo;t been able to offer: self-cleaning braces.</p>
<p>Brackets and wires can both trap food particles <em>and</em> make brushing them away more difficult. This can lead to increased plaque, cavities, and staining around the area of your braces. But with the proper supplies and habits, keeping your braces clean will become routine in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Braces-healthy Supplies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Toothbrush</li>
</ul>
<p>Your old toothbrush might work well enough with some brushing adjustments. We can show you how to angle your brush so it works most effectively, and how to make sure the bristles clean around your braces. Or, if you like, there are actually manual toothbrushes designed just for braces. These have V-shaped bristles to make cleaning around the brackets easier. Some people find an electric toothbrush works best. Whichever type of brush you use, be sure you use it often!</p>
<ul>
<li>Floss</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if regular floss works for you, stay with your normal products. If you are finding it difficult to get into the narrow spaces around your braces, there are floss threaders to get the floss into tight spaces, and flosses specially designed to work with braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interproximal brush</li>
</ul>
<p>A big name for a tiny brush! These little cone-shaped brushes can clean around your brackets and under your wires&mdash;a great way to reach parts of your teeth your regular brush can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Braces-healthy Habits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brush after every meal and sugary drink</li>
</ul>
<p>Because food particles tend to stick to your braces, and the bacteria in plaque feed on these particles, your enamel is under attack without thorough cleaning after meals. Take a toothbrush and supplies with you to school or work so that you can always brush after eating. If there is absolutely no way to brush, be sure to rinse immediately with water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush carefully</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay attention to each tooth, the area around your braces, and your gum line. And don&rsquo;t forget the tops and inside of your teeth! A common suggestion for braces wearers is to devote at least ten seconds to each tooth. We might also recommend a special mouthwash to reduce bacteria and help keep your mouth and breath fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush on the go</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together a cleaning kit for when you are out of the house. A brush, some floss, and toothpaste in a handy container will let you brush whenever you need to, wherever you may be. Leave it in your backpack or bag, and you&rsquo;re ready for anything!</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch your diet</li>
</ul>
<p>Foods that stick to teeth will stick to braces, so avoid caramels, licorice, chewy candies, and any other sticky treats. Why make your life more difficult?</p>
<p>While braces can make brushing and flossing more complicated, you can still keep your teeth clean, bright, and cavity-free. And remember, regular dental exams and professional cleanings are more important than ever during this time. At your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the best products and practices for the cleanest possible teeth and braces. We have plenty of ideas to help make sure you&rsquo;ll have the healthy, beautiful smile you&rsquo;ve worked so hard for when those braces come off!</p>

  <h3>February 12th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/02/start_of_valentines_xl_82886525.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day, also known as Saint Valentine&rsquo;s Day, has been said to originate with a Catholic priest named Valentine several thousand year ago. Valentine defied the emperor at the time by secretly marrying men and their brides after the emperor had made it illegal to marry. Emperor Claudius II did this because he wanted as many single young men to fight in his war as he could get.</p>
<p>Valentine disobeyed the emperor&rsquo;s edict by continuing to marry couples until he was sentenced to death. Before his execution, he sent a letter to a secret love and signed it &ldquo;From your Valentine.&rdquo; Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team have come up with some suggestions on how you can celebrate this Valentine&rsquo;s Day, whether you have a valentine of your own or not.</p>
<p><strong>Valentine's Day Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enjoy a tasty treat</strong>. There are plenty of options when it comes to cooking and/or baking on Valentine&rsquo;s Day. Make your significant other his or her favorite meal or sweet treat, or make your own favorite dish to enjoy on this day. Oh, and be sure to make enough for leftovers!</li>
<li><strong>Make a personalized card</strong>. Instead of buying a card from the grocery store, take the time to make your own for a loved one. People love handwritten notes, especially when it&rsquo;s from someone special. If you&rsquo;re single this Valentine&rsquo;s Day, make a card for fellow single friend to brighten the day and remind the person that he or she is also loved.</li>
<li><strong>Watch a movie</strong>. We all know there are plenty of romance movies out there. Put on your favorite romantic comedy, or pick up your significant other&rsquo;s favorite movie to watch together. Even better, if you&rsquo;re single, pick up your own favorite movies to watch to pass the time this Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</li>
<li><strong>Do nothing!</strong> We all know Valentine&rsquo;s Day can sometimes get a lot of hype. If you&rsquo;re worried about not making a reservation in time, don&rsquo;t feel like planning an extravagant night out, or simply not in the holiday mood this year, spend your day sitting back and relaxing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a time to celebrate love and spend quality hours with the people you care about the most. Whether you&rsquo;re in a relationship or single, take some time today to appreciate those you love in your life.</p>
<p>We wish you a happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day celebration and look forward to seeing you at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office during your next appointment.</p>

<p>If you are feeling a bit sore after your braces have been tightened, a cool treat might be just the thing. Ice cream is the classic choice, but if you are looking for some healthier options, consider yogurt. It generally has less sugar, while still providing soothing, creamy sweetness. A fruit or vegetable smoothie is always a good (and nutritious) choice. Pudding and gelatin cups? Chilly, delicious, and easy to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort Food</strong></p>
<p>Some of our favorite comfort foods mean literal comfort for newly adjusted braces. Creamy soups, soft pastas and noodles, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese are warm, silky options that don&rsquo;t require a lot of chewing. Just don&rsquo;t go too hot or too spicy&mdash;that might irritate sensitive gum and mouth tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Breakfast All Day Long</strong></p>
<p>Most of our favorite braces-friendly breakfast foods are delicious any time of day. Eggs scrambled, fried, or in an omelet are easy on your braces and packed with protein. Are you an oatmeal fan? Try some oatmeal with mashed fruit for a more flavorful bowl. And you can&rsquo;t beat the taste and texture of pillowy pancakes.</p>
<p>The discomfort that follows an adjustment is temporary, but treat your teeth&mdash;and yourself&mdash;gently over the next day or two. Take over-the-counter medication if needed for pain, brush carefully, and eat a comforting, comfortable diet. Soon you will be back to your normal, braces-friendly menu, and one step further on your way to a beautiful smile!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve just gotten braces at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, you&rsquo;ve probably also learned a whole new vocabulary. Malocclusion, brackets, archwires, ligatures, elastics&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got the definitions down. But now you&rsquo;re scheduled for an &ldquo;adjustment.&rdquo; What exactly does <em>that</em> mean?</p>
<p><strong>Why Do I Need an Adjustment?</strong></p>
<p>After all, you&rsquo;ve just gotten braces! But the fact is, moving your teeth to their ideal location is a process that involves many steps. The brackets and wires you have today are only a starting point. Wires, and rubber bands if you need them, put gentle pressure on the teeth, gradually moving them into a better position. Every time we see you, we check the progress you&rsquo;ve made and adjust your braces to move the teeth into even better alignment. It&rsquo;s a careful process to make sure your teeth and jaws fit together perfectly for straight teeth and a healthy bite.</p>
<p><strong>What Will Happen at an Adjustment?</strong></p>
<p>Because your braces are made specifically for you, there is no one answer for everyone or even every appointment. Usually, your ligatures (the colorful bands around your brackets) will be removed, and often the orthodontic wire that is attached to your brackets will be removed as well. We&rsquo;ll check to make sure you are brushing and flossing properly around your wires and brackets, and check on the condition of your braces.</p>
<p>Your wire might be adjusted, or bent, or tightened, or replaced all together. In the beginning, the wire will probably be more flexible. Later in your treatment, you might get a thicker, firmer wire to move your teeth more effectively, or we might bend a wire to move specific teeth.</p>
<p>If you need rubber bands to make sure your bite is in alignment, we&rsquo;ll show you how to attach and take care of those. We&rsquo;ll also look for other adjustments that might need to be made to your brackets. If you have any concerns about brackets, wires, or any other part of your braces, let Drs. Insoft and Hurst know! And once we&rsquo;re done adjusting your braces, this is your chance to change the color of your ligatures for a new look.</p>
<p><strong>Will It Hurt?</strong></p>
<p>You might suffer some discomfort in the hours after an adjustment, so treat yourself gently! Stick to soft foods for a few days, and treat yourself to something cold and soothing like ice cream, yogurt, or a smoothie. Brush gently if your teeth are sensitive. Usually, over-the-counter pain relievers will take care of any soreness. You can even take a pain reliever 30 minutes to an hour before the adjustment if you are expecting some discomfort. We have more great ideas on how to reduce any tenderness you might feel&mdash;let us know if we can suggest some.</p>
<p>Within a day or two, you should be back to normal. If you ever suffer serious discomfort, or if the soreness lasts more than a few days, give us a call.</p>
<p>Remember, each adjustment brings you closer to your goal&mdash;straight teeth and a healthy bite. And that&rsquo;s the definition of a beautiful smile!</p>

  <h3>January 22nd, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2020/01/truth_tmj.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>TMJ is the quick way of referring to your Temporomandibular Joint. Pardon the pun, but that&rsquo;s quite a mouthful! What is this joint, what does it do, and, if your Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team have told you that you have a TMJ disorder, what can we do to help?</p>
<p><strong>The Temporomandibular Joint</strong></p>
<p>Your two temporomandibular joints are amazing works of anatomical design. These are the joints where the temporal bone in the skull meets the mandible bone of the jaw, and allow our mouths to open and close, move back and forth, and slide from side to side. Muscle, bone, and cartilage work together to provide easy movement and to cushion the joint. But sometimes, the joint doesn&rsquo;t work as smoothly as it should, and this can lead to Temporomandibular Joint Disorder, or TMD.</p>
<p><strong>When Should You Suspect You Have TMD?</strong></p>
<p>You might have TMD if you experience any of these symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Painful chewing</li>
<li>Pain around your TMJ, or in your face or neck</li>
<li>Earaches</li>
<li>Changes in your bite</li>
<li>Jaws that are limited in movement or lock open or shut</li>
<li>Clicking, popping or grating noises when you open and shut your jaw</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many conditions linked to TMD. If you grind your teeth at night, have arthritis in the jaw, have suffered an injury or infection in the area, or have problems with your bite, for example, you might be more likely to have TMJ problems. If you suspect you have TMD, or suffer from any of the symptoms listed above for an extended period, give us a call.</p>
<p><strong>Treating TMD</strong></p>
<p>During your visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, we will check your medical history, and examine your head and neck. We can take an X-ray or scan if needed for further examination of the joint. Because there is no real scientific agreement yet about the best way to treat TMJ disorders, a conservative treatment plan is often best. If you do show signs of TMD, we might first suggest relaxation techniques, over-the-counter pain relievers, or the use of ice packs or moist heat compresses. A change to a softer diet can help, and you should stop chewing gum and making any exaggerated jaw movements.</p>
<p>If these self-care practices aren&rsquo;t effective, we might suggest a nightguard. This appliance is a comfortable and flexible mouthguard custom fitted for you, and will bring relief from teeth grinding when worn at night. If this treatment is not effective, talk to us about other options.</p>
<p>Luckily, most cases of TMD are temporary and don&rsquo;t become worse over time. But any persistent discomfort is a good reason to visit us. Whether you have TMD, or any other problem causing you pain in the head or jaw, we want to help.</p>

<p>Colorful elastic ligatures (the official name for those tiny bands around your brackets) are often replaced when you come in to have your braces adjusted. Which is great! Now you have the opportunity to go with your team colors, or your school colors, or tones that work with your skin and eyes, or shades that represent your favorite holiday season. Today&rsquo;s bands come in a wide variety of colors, so you never need to worry about becoming bored with your choices.</p>
<p>But are there certain hues that can be a bit more challenging to work with. Let&rsquo;s look at some of those trickier tones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunch Look-Alikes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want kind friends constantly informing you that you have something stuck in your teeth, you might want to leave certain colors off your list. Dark greens and browns can sometimes give the appearance of food trapped in your braces. Have a look at the shades available, and see what is least likely to send you running for a mirror and a toothbrush.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smile Dimmers</li>
</ul>
<p>A blazing white band might seem like a good match to your blazing white teeth, but for many people, really light colors can make teeth look more yellow. And often bands in shades of yellow can bring out any yellow in your enamel. If you&rsquo;re looking for a brighter smile, try some darker, richer tones for a gleaming contrast.</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re So Over the Rainbow</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are someone who loves a monochromatic look, perhaps any colors will be, well, just <em>too</em> colorful. In that case, there are ligatures for you! Silver or grey braces will blend with your metal brackets, and clear or tooth-colored bands will be less obvious with metal or ceramic brackets. Light colored bands can be more prone to staining, so keep that in mind if you&rsquo;re going for invisibility or a close bracket match.</p>
<p>Now with all that being said, you be you! If you like a color, give it a go. It might be the perfect accessory for your smile and your personality. And, if it doesn&rsquo;t work . . . no big deal! You can explore another part of the color palette on your very next adjustment to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</p>

  <h3>January 8th, 2020</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>Getting braces is a huge step in creating the beautiful smile you want. It&rsquo;s easy to see how important your wires and brackets are. Week by week, you and your family and friends can see the progress you&rsquo;re making as your teeth become straighter. That makes all the careful brushing, periodic adjustments at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, and annoying loose ligatures worthwhile.</p>
<p>And while straight, even teeth are the visible reward you get for your months in braces, there&rsquo;s a benefit that&rsquo;s every bit as important that might go unnoticed by your friends and family&mdash;a healthy, properly aligned bite.</p>
<p>Many people have some kind of malocclusion, or bad bite. There are several different bite problems we treat. Some of the most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overjet (the upper front teeth protrude too far forward over the bottom teeth)</li>
<li>Underbite (the bottom teeth overlap the top teeth)</li>
<li>Crossbite (one or more teeth haven&rsquo;t come in in the proper position, often with an upper tooth fitting inside a lower tooth)</li>
<li>Open bite (the upper and lower front teeth don&rsquo;t touch).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the jaws and teeth don&rsquo;t fit together properly, you might be looking at damaged teeth, headaches, and painful problems with the temporomandibular joint, or jaw joint, in your future. That&rsquo;s why correcting your bite early is so important. Using rubber bands with your braces is one of the most popular and effective ways to help create a better bite.</p>
<p>Bands are used with your braces to gradually move your teeth into their best position. Specially designed brackets with tiny hooks are bonded to very specific teeth. Why so specific? Because the placement of the brackets depends on which type of malocclusion we are correcting. Rubber bands are then attached to the bracket hooks, usually from an upper tooth to a lower one. When they are in just the right position, those little bands provide just enough force to move your teeth more quickly and effectively than braces alone can.</p>
<p>If you need bands to help correct any kind of malocclusion, you will play a very important part in your orthodontic treatment. It will be your job to attach your bands every day. Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;while it can seem confusing at first, we&rsquo;ll make sure you know exactly how and where to place them.</p>
<p><strong>How long should they stay in? </strong>You&rsquo;ll probably need to wear your bands 24 hours a day. It&rsquo;s while you&rsquo;re moving your mouth and jaw muscles that your bands are working their hardest. Talk to us about removing them for brushing and flossing, and whether you should wear them while you eat.</p>
<p><strong>Can you use the same bands over several days?</strong> Not a good idea. Bands are selected for size and strength to move your teeth very precisely from visit to visit. When bands stay on too long, they become too stretched out to supply the proper pressure needed to move your teeth efficiently. Drs. Insoft and Hurst will let you know how long is too long for your specific bands.</p>
<p><strong>Are two bands better than one? </strong>Absolutely not. Again, the bands you&rsquo;re given at each visit are designed for your specific needs. Too much pressure can actually be harmful. Just keep to your recommended schedule of replacing bands, and your orthodontic treatment will stay right on track.</p>
<p>Attaching rubber bands? Keeping them on all during the day? Replacing them as needed? All of these responsibilities might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but we are here to give you all the information and support you need to succeed. Because straight, even teeth and a bite that is healthy and functional? That&rsquo;s truly how you create your beautiful smile!</p>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;re a teenager, you have a lot more responsibility and independence. Choosing high school classes and electives. Getting a driver&rsquo;s license. Landing your first job. And those new responsibilities extend to your dental health as well!</p>
<ul>
<li>Braces</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve just gotten braces, you might feel a bit overwhelmed. Learning how to brush and floss effectively, attaching rubber bands several times a day, keeping track of your hours if you&rsquo;re wearing clear aligners&mdash;it can seem like a lot. But you can do it! With time and practice, caring for your braces will become just another part of your daily routine. Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team are here to make sure you have all the information and tools you need to succeed. The most important thing to remember is that the better you follow our instructions, the quicker and more effective your orthodontic treatment will be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retainers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve successfully completed your orthodontic treatment, dealing with your retainer should be a piece of cake! We will give you clear instructions on how long each day you should wear your retainer. Sticking to this schedule is really important--if you don&rsquo;t wear the appliance as directed, you can undo some of the progress you&rsquo;ve worked so hard to make. And when you&rsquo;re not wearing your retainer, be sure it has a safe life outside your mouth. Keep it in a protective case, and keep it someplace where the puppy/the washing machine/the cafeteria trash bin won&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouthguards</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a mouthguard for sports or athletic activities, wear it! Whether you have an over-the-counter device or a custom fabricated guard, it won&rsquo;t do you any good hiding in your locker. A mouthguard cuts down on tooth and facial injuries caused by falls, physical contact, or other accidents that might happen in your active life. And if you wear braces, ask about a mouthguard designed to fit around them. These custom devices protect your braces <em>and</em> your mouth.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that sticking with your dental routine&mdash;two minutes of brushing morning and night and thorough flossing each day&mdash;will keep your gums and teeth healthy throughout your teen years. And, if you have any questions about your dental health in general, or a specific dental concern, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call! We&rsquo;re here to work with you for a lifetime of beautiful smiles.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve probably all seen that unhappy kid or frazzled parent sifting through trash for a lost retainer. If we&rsquo;re really unlucky, we might have <em>been</em> that unhappy kid or frazzled parent sifting through the unpleasant remains of third period lunch hour. But getting tossed isn&rsquo;t the only risk these appliances face. Read on for ways to keep your retainer (and your parent!) happy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Your Retainer With You</li>
</ul>
<p>Always carry a retainer case. If you automatically put your retainer in its case when you&rsquo;re eating, you are much more likely to remember it then if it has been wrapped up in a napkin on your lunch tray. And, if the worst happens, much more likely to recover it in one piece.</p>
<p>Choose the brightest colored case you can live with, so you will have an easier time locating it if need be, and discuss how to label the case to get it back safely to you--just in case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Your Retainer Intact</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think if you put your retainer in your backpack, or purse, or saxophone case, or athletic bag, it will be safe. It will not. Retainers are designed to be tough enough for everyday wear, but being tossed on the floor while inside a backpack is not everyday wear. Always put your retainer back in its (brightly colored) case before packing it away.</p>
<p>Retainers can warp if they are exposed to heat, so keep them away from potential heat sources like stoves, microwaves, and washers and dryers. Even your car dashboard can become hot enough to warp your retainer. And never use boiling water to clean them.</p>
<p>Finally, your dog might find your retainer to be the #bestchewtoyever, so be sure to put it in a spot pets can&rsquo;t reach when you&rsquo;re not wearing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep Your Retainer Clean</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like plaque can build up on your teeth, minerals and calcium can build up on your retainer. Different types of retainers require different cleaning methods, so talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about how to keep your retainer clean and bacteria-free. We will be happy to give you instructions on the best way to take care of your particular appliance. And don&rsquo;t forget to clean your case regularly!</p>
<p>Accidents will happen, of course. If your retainer is lost or damaged, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office as soon as possible. We might be able to fix minor damage, and, if needed, we can replace a lost retainer quickly.</p>
<p>Your time in braces is over, but your teeth are still stabilizing in their new, healthy positions. Wearing your retainer regularly is the final step in producing the beautiful smile you&rsquo;ve worked so hard for. Keep your retainer clean, keep it safe, and keep it with you, and you can enjoy that smile now and for years to come!</p>

  <h2><a href="../../2019/12/fantastic-elastics.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Fantastic Elastics">Fantastic Elastics</a></h2>
  <h3>December 18th, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2019/12/fantastic_elastics.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>If you already wear traditional braces, you know all about these helpful little rubber rings. But if you are new to the world of braces, you might like to know just what kind of elastics are available and what they can do for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ligatures: Alignment Assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>When you get your braces, the brackets you&rsquo;ve chosen will be bonded to your teeth. Once they are attached securely, an arch wire will be threaded through the brackets to provide consistent gentle pressure, moving your teeth into their best positions. But what holds that wire in place? This is where those tiny, colorful bands, called ligatures, come in. Fit snugly around the wire and the bracket, they keep the wire where it needs to be to move your teeth to a better alignment.</p>
<p>There are also ligatures call &ldquo;c-chain ligatures,&rdquo; or &ldquo;power chains.&rdquo; These tiny ligature bands are connected to each other, and fit across the brackets in one long strip. This design lets them not only hold your wires in place, but help move your teeth closer together at the same time. They come in a variety of sizes depending on the spacing of your teeth, and might be worn weeks or months as needed.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that while ligatures are essential, they are not permanent! Every time you have your wires tightened or replaced, you can make this an opportunity to express your personality through your choice of bands. There is a wide variety of color choices available, so take advantage of it!</p>
<p>Show your school spirit by displaying your high school&rsquo;s colors. Go orange and black for Halloween. Match your ligature tones to your go-to clothing colors. Or, go monochromatic. Match grey or silver bands to your brackets, or choose white or clear bands if you have ceramic brackets. (One word of caution&mdash;light colored ligatures can pick up stains from dark foods and drinks. On the other hand, they won&rsquo;t be around that long!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Rubber Bands: Building Better Bites</li>
</ul>
<p>While ligatures are the colorful attention-getters in the elastics world, there are other bands that do very important work. When you have a malocclusion, or bad bite, your upper and lower jaws don&rsquo;t fit together perfectly. We use rubber bands to align your bite correctly and carefully move it into the proper position. This is accomplished by attaching bands to tiny hooks on specially chosen brackets on the upper and lower teeth. The bands usually connect an upper bracket to a lower one, and are specifically placed to correct your unique bite problem.</p>
<p>If you need this type of elastic, you will play a very important part in making your orthodontic treatment work. You will probably need to wear your bands 24 hours a day, removing them only for brushing and flossing. (Talk to us about how to work with your bands when you are eating, playing an instrument, or wearing a mouthguard.) And they need to be replaced several times a day, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>Even if the bands look perfect, after hours of work, they lose the tightness needed to keep moving your teeth to their best position. Bands that are too loose won&rsquo;t be as effective. On the other hand, doubling the bands is a bad idea because that might apply too much force. Bands come in a variety of sizes and strengths, and yours have been chosen for this specific phase of your treatment. Keep calm, keep to a schedule, and keep a supply of bands on hand in case one breaks, and everything will work out.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a lot of confusing information, don&rsquo;t worry! Drs. Insoft and Hurst will supply you with the right bands for your treatment, clear instructions on where and how to place them, and practice time for putting them in. You&rsquo;ll probably need a mirror at first, but you&rsquo;ll become an expert in no time.</p>
<p>If you ever have questions we can help you with, contact our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office immediately. We are here to guide you through the process and help you with any problems you might have. Wearing your bands consistently and correctly will help you achieve your beautiful smile in the shortest time possible. And that&rsquo;s an accomplishment that is truly fantastic!</p>

<p>The iTero&reg; Intraoral Scanner has revolutionized the way orthodontic impressions are taken. Now there's no need for messy, uncomfortable molds. Getting high-quality and accurate impressions has never been easier or more reliable.</p>
<p>When a patient comes to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for a consultation, Drs. Insoft and Hurst will need to take records of the person&rsquo;s teeth and bite. Having a replica of a patient&rsquo;s teeth and bite enables the orthodontist to plan out and visualize the most effective and timely treatment plan.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this was achieved by creating a plaster mold or cast. Putting the impression material and trays onto the teeth can be an uncomfortable process for many patients, especially those who have a sensitive gag reflex.</p>
<p>All that is history with iTero digital impressions. Our patients and team members alike love the speed and accuracy of the iTero Intraoral Scanner. We simply move the wand around your teeth and gums, and within seconds, you get a high-quality, accurate, and color digital impression. That&rsquo;s all there is to it!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what patients love about iTero:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no messy and gag-inducing molds involved.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s quick, so the process doesn&rsquo;t interfere with your busy schedule.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s painless and can be used on even the most pain-sensitive patients.</li>
<li>Impressions are saved in a digital format, so there&rsquo;s no risk of molds breaking or needing to be recast.</li>
<li>Cutting-edge accuracy makes for more timely, comfortable, and effective orthodontic treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office is equipped with the latest iTero technology to make your office visit a breeze. So many aspects of our lives have been digitized and simplified, why should your orthodontic treatment be any different?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about getting braces or clear aligners, iTero will optimize the experience and help ensure you get the best treatment you possibly can!</p>

<p>When we think braces, we can&rsquo;t help but think of the brackets on each tooth and the colorful ligature bands that surround them. But actually, the whole point of those brackets and bands is to hold the archwire in place as it gradually moves your teeth to create a better bite and a straighter smile. Let&rsquo;s learn more about this talented part of your braces!</p>
<ul>
<li>Wire We Wearing These, Anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>Archwires use gentle, continuous pressure to move your teeth into alignment. That sounds simple, but there is actually a lot going on. Teeth often need more than realigning. Some teeth need to be turned a bit, some tilted. Your teeth need to be better aligned with those next to them, of course, but also need to fit properly with the teeth above or below them. You might have a malocclusion, or bad bite.</p>
<p>How can one wire handle all that? Well, it can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why there are different types of wire. We often use thinner, flexible wires at the beginning of treatment, to put gentle pressure on the teeth as they start their movement. Other wires are firmer, and can be helpful in later phases, when each tooth is carefully moved to its specific, ideal spot. Archwires can be round or rectangular, thicker or thinner, springy or stiff, remember their shape or be bendable&mdash;all depending on what they need to do.</p>
<p>Whew! This sounds confusing, but Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team are archwire experts! At every adjustment appointment, we check on the progress of your alignment and choose the exact wire you need to take you to the next stage of your orthodontic journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Wire</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have braces, it&rsquo;s more challenging to make sure that your teeth are clean after eating. We&rsquo;ll give you advice on how to get rid of the pesky food particles that sometimes get stuck in your braces. First, that&rsquo;s absolutely not the look you&rsquo;re going for. But, more than that, bacteria can use these &ldquo;leftovers&rdquo; as fuel to create the acids that damage your enamel and cause cavities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole new world of dental products out there waiting to help get your braces clean. Special toothbrush heads work in the spaces between your teeth and the archwire. There are floss threaders that can get dental floss into tight places, and flosses with one stiff end you can guide under the wire so you can direct the floss to where it&rsquo;s needed. There are even tiny cone-shaped brushes called &ldquo;interproximal brushes&rdquo; that can fit under your wires to clean around your brackets and teeth.</p>
<p>Take a care kit to school or work with you so you can keep the tooth surface under your wires and around your brackets free of plaque. After all the hard work you&rsquo;ve put in with your braces, the last thing you want is cavities once you&rsquo;ve achieved your beautiful smile!</p>
<ul>
<li>Down to the Wire</li>
</ul>
<p>We said archwires were awesome, but we didn&rsquo;t say they were perfect! We couldn&rsquo;t leave without suggestions for handling any wire-related problems that might come up.</p>
<p>One of the most common problems is the irritation caused by the end of a wire that has somehow come loose. You might be able to use a cotton swab to gently push the wire flat against the tooth. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, orthodontic wax can be used to cover the end of the problem wire and smoothed into place. We&rsquo;ll provide you with instructions on how to handle these and other minor wire problems at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other problems should be run past us first. If you feel your wire is coming loose, or if a loose end is causing a lot of pain and irritation, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. We&rsquo;ll give you instructions on how to help, and make an appointment if necessary for a professional fix.</p>
<p>In fact, call us anytime you have questions about your braces. We&rsquo;re here to help you understand each phase of the orthodontic process as you move step by step on the path to a healthy bite and a beautiful smile. And what&rsquo;s more awesome than that?</p>

<p>How long? Well, a beautiful smile is both science and art&mdash;proper teeth and jaw alignment united with aesthetically pleasing results. Orthodontists achieve both these outcomes with a careful analysis of any dental and facial problems, a treatment plan designed specifically for each patient&rsquo;s needs, and adjustments through each phase of treatment to carefully bring about that beautiful smile.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a long way of saying, there&rsquo;s no one, standard answer as to how long a patient will wear braces because there is no one, standard patient. Often, treatment takes from 18 to 24 months, but it can be months shorter or months longer depending on a variety of different circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different Needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Your orthodontic needs and goals will generally determine your treatment time. Some patients need only a bit of alignment, which can lead to a fairly short orthodontic experience. Some have malocclusions such as crossbites and open bites that require more complex and lengthy treatment.</p>
<p>And, while we used to think of orthodontics as a teenage rite of passage, that&rsquo;s certainly no longer the case. Some children will need two-phase orthodontic treatment, where early procedures before the adult teeth even come in ease the way for any necessary second stage treatment when the permanent teeth arrive years later. And some adults will want orthodontic work later in life, where denser bone tissue might lead to (somewhat) longer treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different Appliances</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s orthodontics offers you many choices in appliances. Lingual braces are an almost invisible option, with brackets and wires on the <em>inside</em> of the teeth. Aligners use clear, custom molded trays to move the teeth into a better position with each new tray. Even traditional braces are smaller and sleeker today, with metal or less visible ceramic brackets. Depending on the orthodontic goals you want to achieve, there might be a small difference in the amount of time each appliance will take to get you to those goals. Talk to us about all your options and what they mean for treatment time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different Levels of Participation in the Process</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one area you <em>can</em> make a real difference! If you follow our instructions for using your appliances most effectively, you&rsquo;ll make progress as quickly as possible. If you have aligner trays, be sure to wear them for as long as directed each day. If you have rubber bands attached to brackets on your upper and lower teeth, wear them for as many hours as required, because these little bands are actually the tools that are moving your teeth into alignment. If you don&rsquo;t wear your braces or aligners as directed, not much is going to happen, and certainly not on schedule.</p>
<p>Give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call, and we can discuss your goals for creating your very best smile. Once we&rsquo;ve decided on a treatment plan, Drs. Insoft and Hurst can give you a fairly good estimate as to how long your particular treatment will take. And, when you get to share that beautiful, healthy smile, the time you&rsquo;ve spent achieving it will be well worth it!</p>

  <h3>November 20th, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><img src="https://blog.sesamehub.com/insoft-michael2/files/2019/11/orthodontic_myths.jpg" style="margin: 5px auto 5px auto" class="aligncenter">
<p>Some myths never wear out their welcome. If the Tooth Fairy helps your child transition from baby teeth to adult teeth, more power to her! On the other hand, some myths we can do without. Here are five common misconceptions about orthodontics, and the reality behind the myth.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s Only Cosmetic</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think orthodontists can make a crooked smile straight, you&rsquo;re right! Creating a beautifully aligned smile is one of our specialties. And if your primary interest is in a straight, even smile for you or your child, that&rsquo;s a good thing. You can&rsquo;t underestimate the confidence a beautiful smile brings. But please don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s all we do. In orthodontics, aesthetics and function work together. An essential part of an orthodontist&rsquo;s work is diagnosing and treating malocclusions, or bad bites. The correct alignment of teeth and jaw is what makes a beautiful smile a healthy one as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>I Don&rsquo;t Need an Orthodontist for Orthodontic Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>All dentists receive comprehensive training and experience in order to earn their dental degrees. But did you know orthodontists like Drs. Insoft and Hurst receive two to three years of additional formal training, concentrating specifically in the field of orthodontics? An orthodontist is a specialist, and diagnoses and treats problems with tooth alignment while taking into account dental, jaw and facial development. That is why an orthodontic specialist is best qualified to create a unique, custom-tailored treatment plan for each patient in order to achieve a beautiful, balanced, and healthy smile.</p>
<ul>
<li>My Child is Too Young for Orthodontic Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>We actually recommend that every child see an orthodontist for an evaluation by the age of seven. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of any potential orthodontic problems that might affect your child&rsquo;s later years, but we can also treat problems even before braces are on the horizon. If your child&rsquo;s mouth is very small, we may recommend gently enlarging the upper dental arch with the use of a palatal expander to accommodate adult teeth as they erupt. If a baby tooth is lost too soon, we can provide a space maintainer so your child&rsquo;s permanent tooth can erupt in the right place. We can even treat bite problems before all the adult teeth arrive. A visit when your child is young might help prevent the need for more complicated treatment in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m Too Old for Orthodontic Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;re really not. As long as your teeth and gums are healthy, orthodontic treatment is a great way to <em>keep</em> them healthy. Crowded teeth and malocclusions can lead to problems like worn or cracked enamel, headaches, jaw problems, increased tooth decay, and periodontal disease, to name but a few. And today&rsquo;s orthodontics offer a much wider variety of treatment options than the metal gear you remember from your high school days. Which leads us to our last myth of the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those Metal Braces Aren&rsquo;t for Me</li>
</ul>
<p>In that case, it&rsquo;s a good thing we have many other options to offer. Ceramic brackets and clear elastic ligatures make traditional braces much less visible. Lingual braces use brackets and wires placed behind the teeth, which are almost impossible to detect. And clear aligners allow you to subtly reposition your teeth with each new aligner tray&mdash;and are removable if need be. In fact, even those metal braces you might remember from your own high school days have gotten smaller and sleeker. Talk to us about the many discreet options available for older <em>and</em> younger patients.</p>
<p>If you are interested in what orthodontics might do for you, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call! We are here to help you discover what&rsquo;s possible and then to design the best possible treatment plan in order to achieve it. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s make your beautiful, healthy smile a reality!</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have made the decision to get orthodontic treatment at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. Now it&rsquo;s time to choose among your various appliance options. Traditional metal brackets and wires, lingual braces, a series of aligners&mdash;they all have positives to recommend them. And for some people, ceramic braces are the clear favorite.</p>
<p>Ceramic braces work like regular metal braces. Brackets are bonded to the front of each tooth, and rubber bands surrounding the brackets hold the arch wire that gradually moves the teeth into alignment.</p>
<p>Ceramic braces, however, use brackets made of clear or tooth-colored ceramic or porcelain which blend beautifully with the color of your tooth. The elastic ligatures, or rubber bands, can be chosen to match the brackets or your enamel. There are self-ligating ceramic brackets which don&rsquo;t use bands at all. Technology is even working on ways to make the arch wire less visible! The end result is braces that are almost undetectable.</p>
<p>If you want a less obvious appliance for professional or personal reasons, talk to us about ceramic braces. As always, there are other factors to consider before you decide, which we will be happy to discuss with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ceramic brackets are very strong, but they are still more brittle than the metal model. If you play a contact sport, these might not be for you. (But whatever braces you choose, please wear a mouthguard when playing sports.)</li>
<li>Ceramic braces might not be ideal depending on the amount of alignment and bite correction that is needed. They might also take a bit more time to bring your teeth into alignment. We will be able to tell you if ceramic braces will work for you and if they might require a longer period to move your teeth to their perfect position.</li>
<li>Brackets can sometimes be somewhat larger (though this isn&rsquo;t always the case), and, because they can be abrasive, are often recommended for upper teeth only. This way, the lower teeth will not impact, or be impacted by, contact with the upper teeth.</li>
<li>Oral hygiene can trickier with ceramic braces. Although today&rsquo;s brackets aren&rsquo;t as prone to staining, you still need to be careful to brush away the plaque that can accumulate around the brackets. And the bands are susceptible to staining by the usual suspects&mdash;coffee, tea, colas, blueberries, or any strongly colored food or beverage.</li>
<li>Costs will differ depending on the treatment method you choose. Talk to us about cost comparisons with other orthodontic treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ceramic braces, because they are so much less visible, are a popular orthodontic option, especially for older teenagers and adults. If you are interested, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about this effective way to straighten your teeth&mdash;discreetly. Ceramic might be the clear solution for creating your lasting, beautiful smile.</p>

<p>Birthdays. Valentine&rsquo;s Day. Halloween. A trip to the movies. There are just some occasions where a sweet treat is on the menu. Now that you are getting braces, does that mean you have to give up desserts completely? Not at all! The trick to finding the right treat is to know which foods are safe for your braces and which should wait until your treatment is complete.</p>
<p>There are some foods which should always be avoided. They fall into three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard and Crunchy</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard candies, peanut brittle, popcorn balls, nutty candy bars&mdash;anything that is hard to bite into is hard on your braces, and can damage brackets or even break them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chewy</li>
</ul>
<p>Caramels, taffy, chewy squares and rolls, licorice and other super-chewy candies can break brackets and bend wires. Not to mention, they are really difficult to clean from the surface of teeth and braces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticky</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft foods are generally fine, but soft and sticky candies are another thing entirely. Gumdrops, jelly beans, most gum and other sticky treats stick to your braces, making it hard to clean all that sugar from around your brackets. And even soft sticky candies can bend wires or damage your brackets.</p>
<p>As you have probably noticed, almost all candy falls into one of these categories. Of course, while sugary treats shouldn&rsquo;t be a major part of anyone&rsquo;s diet, and careful brushing and flossing are always on the menu if you do indulge, wearing braces does not mean giving up on treats entirely. A better alternative when you are craving something sweet is to choose something that avoids crunchy, chewy and sticky hazards, such as soft puddings, cupcakes or cookies. There are even some candy brands that are safe for your braces.</p>
<p>Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst the next time you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office about the dos and don&rsquo;ts of desserts&mdash;we have tasty suggestions that will make those special occasions both sweet for you and safe for your orthodontic work!</p>

<p>It may come as a surprise to learn that dogs, like humans, have both baby and adult teeth. Most dogs, <em>un</em>like humans, have all of their adult teeth by the time they are seven months old, so it&rsquo;s time to start looking after their dental health when they are still puppies.</p>
<p>While dogs generally don&rsquo;t develop cavities, periodontal disease is the one of the most common diseases affecting dogs. Periodontal disease starts when the bacteria in your pet&rsquo;s mouth form plaque. The plaque can harden into tartar, and, if plaque and tartar spread under the gum line, can be responsible for a number of serious problems. Veterinarians warn that tooth loss, tissue damage, bone loss and infection can be the result of periodontal disease. Professional dental treatment is important if your dog is suffering from periodontal disease, and your vet can describe the options available to you. But the time to act is before disease develops. Let&rsquo;s bone up on some preventative care!</p>
<p><strong>Brushing</strong></p>
<p>There are brushes and toothpastes designed especially for your dog. Train your puppy from an early age to open his mouth to allow you to examine his teeth and gums. (This will also come in handy if you ever need to give him medicine.) Most dogs will accept brushing, and toothpastes come in dog-friendly flavors. Human toothpaste should never be used because it contains cleaners and abrasives that should not be swallowed by your pet. There are also dental wipes available that can be used once and thrown away. Your vet can advise you how to ease your pet into a brushing routine.</p>
<p><strong>Gels and Rinses</strong></p>
<p>Whether you rub an antiseptic gel on your dog&rsquo;s teeth or squirt an antiseptic rinse into his mouth, these formulas can reduce the build-up of plaque. Not all dogs take to the taste of these solutions, but in general they are safe and effective. Ask your vet for recommendations if you would like to try this method.</p>
<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>
<p>Several dietary products offer anti-plaque ingredients or a kibble shape designed to reduce the formation of plaque. Talk to your vet for the best possible diet and nutrition suggestions for your unique pet.</p>
<p><strong>Chew Toys</strong></p>
<p>Chewing can help reduce plaque build-up if done consistently, and chew toys should be chosen for tooth and digestive safety. Some animal-based products and hard plastic toys are so rigid that they can cause damage to teeth or gums, so be sure to look for safe toys.&nbsp; Dogs shouldn&rsquo;t be left alone with toys due to choking or swallowing hazards&mdash;if the chew toy becomes small enough to cause choking, or your dog is swallowing large chunks that might not be digestible, time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your veterinarian is the best resource for maintaining your dog&rsquo;s health and developing a dental routine both you and your pet can live with. When your four-legged friend goes for his next check-up, ask your vet what you can do to keep him and his smile fetching for a long, long time.</p>

  <h2><a href="../../2019/06/braces-and-band-play-on.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Braces and Band? Play On!">Braces and Band? Play On!</a></h2>
  <h3>June 19th, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>You&rsquo;re in the band and you&rsquo;re getting braces. Now what? If you are a member of the string or percussion sections, you can go back to rehearsal. You&rsquo;re good to go. When your talents have seated you in the reed or brass sections, though, a little adjustment might be necessary to keep your instrument and your braces working in harmony.</p>
<p>If you play a wind instrument, you know the term embouchure&mdash;the way you position and use your lips, tongue, facial muscles, and teeth to produce the sound you want. Depending on the instrument you play, you might be completely unaffected when you get your braces, or you might need to develop a more comfortable embouchure to accommodate them.</p>
<p><strong>Wires and Woodwinds?</strong></p>
<p>If you play a wind instrument such as the flute or piccolo, you might find that your normal lip positioning or blowing angle is affected by your braces, but usually the adjustment time is fairly short. Reed instruments such as the saxophone, clarinet, oboe, and bassoon are considered some of the easiest to adjust to when you have braces, but even though the single and double reed mouthpieces don&rsquo;t require as much pressure as brass instruments, there can still be an adjustment period. One thing you should look out for is more condensation in your mouthpiece or instrument&mdash;be sure to keep your instrument clean to keep your sound pure.</p>
<p><strong>Brackets and Brass?</strong></p>
<p>Brass instruments require mouthpiece pressure. This leaves your lips pressed between the mouthpiece and your braces. For this reason, many brass players have a more challenging adjustment when wearing braces. Smaller mouthpieces (trumpet, French horn) usually require more pressure than larger ones (tuba, trombone). It&rsquo;s important to learn how to use technique to avoid cuts, irritation, and other injuries caused by the pressure of your braces against your lips. Learning to play with less pressure on the lips and more air control and breath support will help you to recover your tone and range of notes while protecting your lips and mouth.</p>
<p><strong>How Can We Help?</strong></p>
<p>Let Drs. Insoft and Hurst know if you play, or plan to play, a wind instrument. We might be able to offer some suggestions. For regular metal and ceramic braces, some musicians find extra wax is helpful in preventing lip and cheek injuries. There are brace guards available that can be applied over the braces to protect your lips and mouth if wax doesn&rsquo;t do the trick.</p>
<p>There are also alternatives to regular bracket-and-wire braces, depending on your orthodontic needs, cost factors, and length of treatment. Invisalign&reg; devices fit smoothly over your teeth and can even be removed when it is time to practice or play, as long as you get the necessary hours of wear in per day. In some cases, lingual braces, where the brackets and wires are placed behind the teeth, might be the best choice for you.</p>
<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t forget to talk to your music instructor. Don&rsquo;t be dismayed if you find the quality of your playing has been affected. Your teacher might have valuable suggestions for adjusting your embouchure, playing with less pressure on the lips, and developing better air and breath support. You might need to shorten your practice time at first, and there might be another period of adjustment after your braces come off.</p>
<p>Above all, take care of yourself! If something is poking your lip or cheek, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office immediately before it causes injury. It might be difficult at first, but finding an embouchure that works for your comfort and technique is worth it. And remember, these temporary fine-tunings will lead to a wonderful coda: skilled musicianship and a beautiful, healthy smile. Bravo!</p>

<p>Now that you are working hard to improve your dental health and appearance with your braces, it might seem like a logical time to whiten your teeth as well. But should you go ahead with home kits or a professional whitening? The answer might be yes, but not quite yet!</p>
<p><strong>Toothpaste</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to whiten teeth is regular use of a whitening toothpaste. But these do not make a major difference in tooth color and may also contain abrasives which can damage ceramic brackets and make them more likely to stain. And, whether you have metal or ceramic braces, the brackets used are bonded to your teeth. Any part of your tooth covered by a bracket will not be affected by the whitening paste. Ask our office if you are thinking of using one of these products. We will be happy to recommend the best toothpastes to use while your braces are in place.</p>
<p><strong>Whitening Strips and Trays</strong></p>
<p>Whiteners can be applied at home with strips or tray kits. Strips are coated with a whitening gel and then pressed around your teeth. Tray kits provide a mouthguard-like appliance, which is filled with whitening gel. But neither strips nor tray solutions will whiten any area covered by brackets. When your braces come off, there might be noticeable differences in color on each tooth. Strips are difficult to apply with braces, and trays need to be custom-designed to fit your braces and make sure they don&rsquo;t disturb your orthodontic work. One size most definitely does not fit all! Finally, these whitening agents can cause tooth and gum sensitivity, especially around the time of adjustments. Many manufacturers do not recommend using their products while you have braces. Please talk to us if you are thinking of using them.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Whitening</strong></p>
<p>A dental professional can whiten your teeth in office for the best possible results. The most effective treatments for your unique teeth are combined with protective care of your gums and mouth. Whether this treatment is appropriate while you have braces is something we are happy to discuss.</p>
<p>The best way to keep your teeth bright is to keep up your regular dental routine! Brushing and flossing are more important than ever now, because plaque builds up around brackets. Avoid foods that stain teeth and rinse or brush after every meal and snack. Drs. Insoft and Hurst will show you the best way to take care of your teeth while your braces are on&mdash;and that includes the best way to keep them white and bright. Talk to us about the perfect time to whiten your beautiful smile during your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. And if you have to wait a few extra days for the smile you&rsquo;ve been working toward, truly, the wait will be worth it!</p>

<p>We probably all remember sitting through history lessons during our schooling years. Revolutionary war heroes, English royals, and pop-culture icons filled the pages of our textbooks. Although you may recall a detail or two about their historical significance, how much do you know about their teeth?</p>
<p>Picture England in the mid 1500s. People wore frilly clothes as they hustled along the street, and talked about the latest import from the Indies: sugar. Wealthy Brits did not hesitate to indulge their sweet tooth, and it was no different for the monarch, Queen Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>The queen was especially fond of sweets, but not so fond of the dentist. Her teeth rotted; they turned black and gave off a foul odor. Eventually, Elizabeth lost so many teeth that people found it difficult to understand her when she spoke.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the Revolutionary-era colonies in the 1770s and we encounter the famous dentures of George Washington. They were not made of wood, but rather a combination of ivory and human teeth, some of which were his own pulled teeth and some he purchased from slaves.</p>
<p>Washington did not practice proper dental hygiene throughout his life. He began to suffer dental problems as early as age 24, when he had his first tooth pulled. By the time he was inaugurated in as the first president in 1789, he had only one tooth remaining in his mouth, which was pulled in 1796.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s dentures were made too wide and never quite fit his mouth properly. He complained that they were painful to wear and caused his jaw to protrude visibly outward.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard of Doc Holliday, you know him as the gun-toting, mustached criminal that ran the Wild West in the late 1800s. You might be surprised to learn that John Henry &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Holliday actually had a career as a dentist.</p>
<p>He graduated from dental school in 1872 and began to practice in Griffin, Georgia. Holliday was later diagnosed with tuberculosis and his violent coughing fits during exams drove patients away. Jobless, he packed his bags for Texas and spent the rest of his days running from town to town as a criminal.</p>
<p>The Beatles brought pop music and British culture to their fans, as well as &hellip; teeth? In the mid-1960s, John Lennon had a molar removed that he presented as a gift to his housekeeper, Dorothy. Dorothy&rsquo;s daughter was a huge fan of the Beatles and he thought she might like to a keepsake. Her family held onto the tooth until 2011, when they auctioned it off to a Canadian dentist for $31,000.</p>
<p>These historical figures had very different experiences with their teeth, but it&rsquo;s safe to say a bit of extra brushing and flossing could&rsquo;ve saved them a lot of trouble. Whether you&rsquo;re queen, president, or an average citizen, it&rsquo;s up to you to practice good dental hygiene!</p>
<p>Ask a member of our team at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office if you have any questions about how to keep your teeth in top shape!</p>

<p>In the long run, wearing braces is so worth it. Whether you&rsquo;re working toward straight teeth, an improved bite, or both, you&rsquo;ll end up with a beautiful smile! But sometimes, in the short run, they can be really annoying. Braces can irritate your lips, tongue, and cheeks while you are getting used to them or after an adjustment. Or a problem wire can poke the inside of your mouth and you can&rsquo;t see us immediately for a repair. At times like these, Drs. Insoft and Hurst will recommend orthodontic wax to make your life more comfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Orthodontic Wax?</li>
</ul>
<p>Orthodontic wax is made from non-toxic products like beeswax, carnauba wax, and paraffin wax. Some products might contain extras like vitamin E, aloe, or flavorings. The soft wax covers the bracket or wire that is bothering you with a smooth surface that won&rsquo;t irritate sensitive mouth tissue and will give sore areas a chance to heal.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if I Swallow a Piece?</li>
</ul>
<p>All dental wax is made of non-toxic ingredients. If you accidentally swallow a bit, no need to worry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is It Hard to Apply?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard, but it takes a bit of practice. First, locate the wire or bracket that is causing the problem. You might know where it is right away, or be able to discover it by discovering which sharp bracket or wire is across from the sore spot in your mouth.</p>
<p>Always wash your hands first. Brush and floss, so you will have a clean surface to apply the wax. The drier the surface, the better the wax will stick, so let the area air dry or use something clean such as sterile gauze to dry around the bracket. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The wax is actually quite easy to work with. Break off a small piece of wax (no bigger than the size of a popcorn kernel or a pea), roll it in your fingers to soften it, and press the wax firmly but carefully over the problem bracket or wire until it sticks. Rub until the wax is smooth. Don&rsquo;t worry, we will be happy to show you just how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I Eat with Wax in Place?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find that you can eat without much irritation, it&rsquo;s better to eat without wax over your braces. Remove the wax before eating and brush carefully to remove any food particles from your braces before applying new wax. If you do snack while using wax, be sure to change it after you eat. Wax, after all, sticks easily to your braces&mdash;and food particles stick to wax! Not a good look, and not good for your teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brushing and Flossing</li>
</ul>
<p>Take off any wax before you brush and floss. Your toothbrush will thank you!</p>
<p>You probably have lots of other questions. Can you sleep with wax on your braces? Will it help you be more comfortable at trumpet practice? That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here! If you have any questions at all about orthodontic wax and how to use it, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. We want to make sure that the months you spend wearing braces are as comfortable as possible on your way to a lifetime of beautiful smiles. It&rsquo;s so worth it!</p>

<p>Did you know your toothbrush could be covered with almost ten million germs? We know &hellip; it&rsquo;s gross! That&rsquo;s why you should know how to store your toothbrush properly, and when it&rsquo;s time to replace it.</p>
<p>If you need to brush up on your toothbrush care knowledge, we&rsquo;ve got you covered so brushing will always leave you feeling squeaky clean.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping a Clean Toothbrush</strong></p>
<p>Your mouth is home to hundreds of types of microorganisms, so it&rsquo;s normal for some of them to hang onto your toothbrush after you&rsquo;ve used it. Rinsing your brush thoroughly with water after each use can get rid of leftover toothpaste and food particles that cling to the bristles. Some dentists suggest soaking your toothbrush in mouthwash every now and then can help reduce the amount of bacteria further.</p>
<p>Store your toothbrush in a cool, open environment away from the toilet or trash bin to avoid airborne germs. Closed containers should be avoided because they provide a warm, wet habitat that bacteria love to grow in.</p>
<p>If you have multiple people sharing one sink, an upright holder with different sections will keep everyone&rsquo;s brushes separated and avoid cross contamination. In addition, we would hope this is a no-brainer, but please don&rsquo;t share toothbrushes!</p>
<p>Microwaves and dishwashers are not suitable tools for cleaning a toothbrush, because brushes aren&rsquo;t built to last through this kind of treatment. If you want a really clean toothbrush, your best option is simply to buy a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Replacing Your Toothbrush</strong></p>
<p>The American Dental Association recommends you replace your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner depending on individual circumstances. Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team agree. If you have braces, tend to brush too strongly, or the bristles become frayed, it&rsquo;s time for a new brush.</p>
<p>Children will also need replacement brushes more frequently than adults. If you or your child has been sick, you should replace the toothbrush immediately to avoid re-exposing yourself to illness.</p>
<p>Worn-out brushes are not only unsanitary, they don&rsquo;t do a good job cleaning teeth. Bristles that are worn out and dull won&rsquo;t scrape away plaque and bacteria as well as a fresh toothbrush can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the idea of ten million germs can be worrisome, if you take a few small precautions, you may ensure your toothbrush stays in good shape. And the cleaner the toothbrush, the cleaner the smile!</p>

<p>You know the school day&rsquo;s over when you hear these seven little words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m home! Is there anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before your child got braces, you had the answer: simple, tasty snacks that provided not only an energy boost, but nutritional elements to help build strong teeth and strong bodies. But now whole carrot sticks and unsliced apples are out. Nuts and crunchy peanut butter? Not in your pantry. Hard cheeses and crunchy whole grain crackers? Also off the shopping list.</p>
<p>Because any foods that are crunchy, chewy, or hard to bite into can damage brackets and wires, it&rsquo;s time to freshen up your go-to snack list. Luckily, Drs. Insoft and Hurst can recommend many healthy and braces-friendly choices when children need something to tide them over until dinner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruits and Vegetables for Vitamins and Minerals</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft fruits like berries, melon, and bananas provide essential vitamins and minerals while going easy on your child&rsquo;s braces. Make it a blended smoothie for a cool treat&mdash;you can even add a healthy handful of spinach or kale without interfering with that fruity taste. If your child still loves apples and carrots best, keep them on hand&mdash;but remember that thin slices are the only way to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dairy Delivers Calcium</li>
</ul>
<p>Cottage cheese, string cheese, and other soft cheeses provide essential calcium and vitamin D. Yogurt in all its many flavors is another great option.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meats Provides Protein</li>
</ul>
<p>Lean meats such as thinly sliced ham, chicken, or turkey provide flavor and protein, and don&rsquo;t require the chewing that bologna, roast beef, and salami do. And nothing packs a protein punch like eggs&mdash;hard boiled, deviled, or diced up in egg salad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grains, Legumes, and Vegetables for Complex Carbohydrates</li>
</ul>
<p>Complex carbohydrates&mdash;the &ldquo;good&rdquo; carbs&mdash;are important sources of energy for our bodies. Snacks such as hummus with soft whole grain pita wedges or blended black bean dip and soft crackers are a delicious, energizing option.</p>
<p>You are constantly looking for ways to make your children&rsquo;s lives better. Mix and match any of these foods for a snack that&rsquo;s not only good for their braces, but good for their teeth and bodies! Let us know your child&rsquo;s favorite snack the next time you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office!</p>

  <h3>May 8th, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>We all want to live our healthiest lives. We know that part of keeping ourselves healthy is regular visits to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for checkups and necessary dental work. And that dental work might require an X-ray. Should the amount of radiation in an X-ray concern us?</p>
<p>First, it is helpful to know that the radiation you are exposed to from a dental X-ray is very small. A set of most bitewing X-rays, for example, produces an amount of exposure about equal to the amount of background radiation we get from our normal surroundings in a typical day. We also take care to minimize your exposure even further by using specially designed equipment and protective shielding, and taking only necessary X-rays. If your child is very young, if you are pregnant, or if you have other health concerns, talk to us about the advisability of X-rays and whether they are essential to treatment.</p>
<p>Second, much of our careful general examination will be done visually. Drs. Insoft and Hurst can check for cavities and other problems and assess tooth and gum health. But sometimes, there are conditions which can&rsquo;t be detected without an X-ray.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decay that isn&rsquo;t visible in an oral exam&mdash;if a small cavity develops between teeth, or is hidden underneath a filling, an X-ray will catch it before more damage can take place.</li>
<li>Infection&mdash;An X-ray will reveal infections such as abscesses that can damage both bone and tooth, and gum disease that has harmed bone and connective tissue.</li>
<li>Orthodontic and periodontal issues&mdash;We might need an X-ray to determine the spacing and development of your child&rsquo;s incoming teeth and maturing jaw structure, to properly create braces for adults or children, or to place an implant within the jawbone.</li>
<li>If you are a new patient, it is helpful to have complete X-rays taken as a baseline of your current dental health and previous dental work. This baseline allows us to track tooth and jaw development, if necessary, and to evaluate any future changes that might be a concern. (If you have had X-rays taken in another office, we can help you have them transferred so we have a background of your dental history.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the radiation from a dental X-ray is minimal, be assured that we will never request any unnecessary procedure. When we recommend an X-ray, we do so to make sure there is no decay or infection threatening the health of your gums and teeth, and that we have the essential knowledge we need to treat any dental, periodontal, or orthodontic condition. Because we all want to live our healthiest lives&mdash;and part of that healthy life is both active and proactive dental care.</p>

  <h3>May 8th, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so excited to celebrate Mother’s Day this weekend! In anticipation of this special day, we’ll be giving all of the moms in our office a flower because they deserve it. We are in awe of all of the selfless, caring, loving, nurturing, and guiding mothers out there who work hard year round. They are everything to us! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this month’s blog, we asked some of our team members to answer a few questions about their moms in honor of this sweet holiday. </span></p>
<p><b>What’s a fun memory you have with your mom?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We just watch our favorite TV shows together.  We also like to get a big jar of jelly beans and try to guess the flavors.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candice- </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom used to drive me to school in her pajamas and we would always see a Pepsi delivery truck out at the same time as us.  Anytime we see one now, we scream out Pepsi Man!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kasia-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She wrapped our gifts in Toilet Paper!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen- </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me and my brother were trying to make breakfast for mom.  A jelly jar fell and sliced open my brother's foot so we spent Mother's Day in the ER one year!</span></p>
<p><b>How do you typically celebrate Mother's Day with your family?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With a relaxing Spa Day!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandi-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We have a cookout with our family and bring flowers for mom.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris- </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love baking my mom a cake. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I bring my mom flowers, a card, and go to lunch with her.</span></p>
<p><b>What's the best piece of advice your mom has ever given you?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jen-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don't care about what others think of you.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You are stronger than you think.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalie-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Be yourself.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becky-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dream big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers are the rock of our families and as we all tend to realize as we get older, they are always right. We encourage you to acknowledge their selflessness every day, not just once a year. We hope you get to spoil the mothers in your life this Mother’s Day!</span></p>

  <h3>May 1st, 2019</h3>

<p>Self-ligating braces have actually been around since the 1930&rsquo;s, but recent improvements in technology have made them more popular than ever before. What makes them different? Let&rsquo;s compare with traditional braces.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>Traditional braces make use of bands around the brackets to hold the adjusting wire in place. &ldquo;Self-ligating&rdquo; means &ldquo;self-binding&rdquo; or &ldquo;self-tying.&rdquo; These braces also use brackets, but with a very different design. Self-ligating brackets have mechanisms such as &ldquo;doors&rdquo; or clips, which hold the wire to the bracket without the need for rubber bands or metal ligatures.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>All braces types will straighten your teeth. Some orthodontic conditions, such as moderate crowding of the teeth, appear to respond more quickly to self-ligating braces. Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the difference in treatment time that you might expect with different types of braces.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>
<p>Some users find self-ligating braces more comfortable because they reduce friction and pressure on the teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Oral Hygiene</strong></p>
<p>Self-ligating brackets are easier to clean than brackets with bands. Bands hold on to food particles and can be difficult to clean completely, leaving bacteria and plaque on the teeth even after brushing.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
<p>What most people notice first about braces are the colored bands or metal ligatures holding the wires in place. Without these ligatures, brackets are smaller and less noticeable. There are even clear brackets available for an almost invisible look. It you don&rsquo;t want your braces to make a colorful statement, these might be the choice for you!</p>
<p>If you are interested in self-ligating braces as an option in your orthodontic care, give us a call at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office! We will be happy to explain the technology in greater detail, and to provide you with the best and most complete information you&rsquo;ll need to make your choice of braces the right choice for you.</p>

<p>Convertible or sedan? Downtown or suburbs? Electric or manual toothbrush? As life decisions go, it&rsquo;s certainly not choosing your next car, or deciding where you want to live. But, even when you are selecting a toothbrush, it helps to make a list of the pros and cons of the contenders before you make that final selection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important factor in choosing a toothbrush is finding out which model works best to eliminate bacteria and plaque. And studies have shown that, used properly, both electric and manual toothbrushes do a great job of removing plaque. Some electric models can reach the backs of teeth and the gumline more easily, some manual head designs work better for your individual mouth and teeth, so your particular needs should dictate which style of toothbrush you use. Talk to us about the best methods to brush with your preferred toothbrush, and we&rsquo;ll let you know if one type of toothbrush or the other might work better for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health Considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>Brushing too energetically can actually harm teeth and gums, causing sensitivity and damage to the enamel and gum tissue. An electric toothbrush should provide a continuous brushing motion without needing any pressure from the brusher. This might be the model for you if you have a too-vigorous approach to brushing, or sensitive teeth and gums.</p>
<p>An electric toothbrush can also be more efficient for older and younger brushers, those with limited mobility, and those with health conditions or injuries that make brushing with a regular toothbrush more difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>An electric toothbrush is not a one-time investment. You should change the removable head as often as you change your manual toothbrush (every three to four months, please). But this cost is offset if an electric toothbrush is more efficient in removing your plaque, easier to use, or even if you just prefer it to manual brushing. If you find that you brush better and more often with an electric toothbrush, the added expense is well worth it.</p>
<p>Whichever brush you decide on, the most important part of the brush is the person holding it! A regular appointment with your toothbrush for two minutes of thorough brushing in the morning and two in the evening, daily flossing, and regular visits to our office for checkups and cleanings will keep your teeth healthy and strong no matter which toothbrush you choose.</p>
<p>Questions about your toothbrush choices? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask Drs. Insoft and Hurst at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</p>

<p>Orthodontists like Drs. Insoft and Hurst recommend a first orthodontic visit and evaluation for your child around the age of seven. We will evaluate your child&rsquo;s jaw and facial development and make sure that there is enough room in the mouth for the permanent teeth when they arrive. One of the recommendations we might make for early treatment is the use of a palatal expander. If you are unfamiliar with this device, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at why it&rsquo;s necessary and what exactly it does.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we recommend the palatal expander?</strong></p>
<p>There are two dental arches, composed of the upper and the lower teeth, in your child&rsquo;s mouth. This arch-shaped design is meant to accommodate all the permanent teeth. Further, when the upper and lower teeth meet, they should result in a healthy occlusion, or bite.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the upper dental arch is simply too small to accommodate all of your child&rsquo;s permanent teeth, leading to crowding, extractions, and impacted teeth. Also, a too-narrow arch can result in a crossbite, where some of the upper teeth bite inside the lower ones. An improper bite can lead to problems such as TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorder, improper wear and stress on teeth, certain speech difficulties, and other potential complications. The palatal expander was designed to prevent these problems from occurring.</p>
<p><strong>What is a palatal expander and how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The expander itself is a device that increases the size of the upper dental arch. Before your child&rsquo;s bones are finished growing, the space between the two bones of the upper palate is filled with cartilage. This tissue is flexible when children are young, but gradually fuses solidly into place by the time they are finished growing (usually in the early to mid-teens). If the arch can be widened to accommodate the emerging permanent teeth, or to reduce malocclusions, this improvement can also affect the need for, and length of, future dental work.</p>
<p>There are several types of expanders available at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. These are custom-made appliances, commonly attached between the upper teeth on each side of the jaw. The two halves of the device are connected with a screw-type mechanism that can be adjusted to widen the upper palate and dental arch with gentle pressure. This is a gradual process, with small adjustments usually made once or twice a day to slowly move the bones further apart. As weeks go by, you will notice a successful change in the spacing of the teeth. Your child might even develop a gap in the front teeth, which is normal and will generally close on its own.</p>
<p>If you would like more detailed information, talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst about the palate expander. We can tell you what to expect from this treatment if we think it is best for your child&rsquo;s unique needs, and how to make it as easy as possible for your child. Our goal is to provide your child with the healthiest teeth and bite possible, always making use of treatments that are both gentle and effective.</p>

<p>Well, of course, they already <em>are</em> working for you&mdash;as an essential part of the alignment process. Rubber bands, also known as elastic ligatures, are used to secure the wires inside your brackets. But bands can be more than functional. Since the ligatures around each bracket are replaced when you visit our office, why not use that opportunity to choose a new color scheme as well?</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a Statement</li>
</ul>
<p>Bands offer a chance to coordinate your braces to an interest, team, or event. Are you a swimmer? Maybe cool blues and turquoises appeal to you. Batman forever? Black and yellow. (That will work for beekeepers, too.) Have a favorite sports team? Choosing team colors will support your team with every smile. Love your school? Show your spirit by wearing bands in your school colors. Favorite time of year? Celebrate by selecting festive bands in holiday colors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suit Your Mood</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiery reds and oranges, tranquil blues and greens, millennial purples and pinks, or exuberant neon&mdash;you know that there are just some colors that suit your personality. Showcase that personality with your choice of band color. And if your mood changes, choose shades that express a completely different side of you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinate Your Colors</li>
</ul>
<p>Match your bands to your eye color, your makeup, or the clothing colors you choose most often. If there&rsquo;s a color profile that works for you, make your bands a part of it. If you don&rsquo;t want everything matching, complement your coloring or clothing with a different but coordinating shade for a cohesive effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a Low Profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Most adults will stick with a monochromatic set of bands, and this might be a look that appeals to you as well. Grey and silver bands will blend nicely with silver braces. If you have clear or white brackets, you might want to test out which bands will be least noticeable. Clear bands can become discolored, and white bands can make teeth look darker. If there&rsquo;s a band which mimics your own tooth color, this will be the choice for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Color Theory Work for You</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain colors and tints bring out the best in your tooth color and work with your skin tones. White and yellow bands might make teeth appear duller, and any shade combination that resembles food particles (greens, browns, and black) is probably not a look you&rsquo;re going for. Have fun with a color wheel and decide which colors you find most flattering.</p>
<p>Make your bands more than a tool&mdash;make them an accessory. There are so many colorful options available that you are bound to happen on a color scheme that just suits you. And if you change your mind? Change it up during your next visit to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office!</p>

  <h2><a href="../../2019/03/early-orthodontics.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Early Orthodontics">Early Orthodontics</a></h2>
  <h3>March 27th, 2019</h3>

<p>Perhaps you are already planning for the years when your teenager will need orthodontic work. But hearing that your seven-year-old would benefit from orthodontic treatment? That might come as a complete surprise! It&rsquo;s a recommendation with real benefits, though&mdash;early intervention can save children from tooth and bite problems now, and even simplify their future orthodontic care.</p>
<p>Treating young children for orthodontic problems is called &ldquo;interceptive orthodontics.&rdquo; When the permanent teeth start arriving, there might be problems with spacing, bite or protruding teeth. Often, treatment while the bones are still growing is the best way to prevent more serious problems later.</p>
<p>We recommend that your child have an orthodontic consultation with Drs. Insoft and Hurst around the age of seven. This exam is especially important for children who may have been thumb suckers or used a pacifier after the age of three, or if you notice obvious teeth, speech or bite issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowding and Spacing Issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Teeth are arranged in two crescent shapes called arches. When the arch of your child&rsquo;s mouth is small, the permanent teeth can become very crowded as they erupt. Formerly, teeth were removed to make more room. Now, early use of a palatal expander can enlarge the upper dental arch in order to help the permanent teeth come in without crowding. The need for future tooth extraction is reduced, and there is a better chance for correct spacing and alignment with early treatment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a child loses a tooth too soon, too much space left between baby teeth can also be a problem. The remaining teeth can shift, leaving the wrong place open for the adult tooth to come in. We might recommend a space maintainer so that there is no shifting of the teeth and there is room for the proper adult tooth to erupt in its proper spot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Malocclusions (Bite Problems)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some malocclusions, like a crossbite, can be caused by problems with jaw and facial structure. Again, we might recommend a palatal expander to help the upper arch of the teeth to fit properly with the lower jaw. Problems with overbite, open bite and other bite issues can also be addressed at this age if necessary. Early care can discourage TMJ (temporomandibular joint) disorders, reduce speech problems, and improve facial symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Protruding Front Teeth</li>
</ul>
<p>Teeth that protrude are much more likely to be damaged when playing or after a fall. Methods such as braces or appliances can reposition them and protect them from breaking or fracturing.</p>
<p>Many children will not need early intervention, and many can wait until they are older for orthodontic work. But if your young child has orthodontic problems that should be addressed, early intervention can do more than set the stage for successful orthodontics in the teen years. Talk to our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL team about what we can do for your child. Interceptive orthodontics can protect teeth, guide jaw and speech development, modify harmful oral habits and help to adjust bite problems before they become serious&mdash;when it comes to your child&rsquo;s dental health, the best solutions are early ones!</p>

<p>You might be surprised to learn that Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team recommend an orthodontic appointment even before your child has had that last visit from the Tooth Fairy. In fact, orthodontic assessments at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office can be beneficial at many stages of your child&rsquo;s life. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the reasons why.</p>
<p><strong>The Right Spaces</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why we recommend that every child see an orthodontist by the age of seven. If there&rsquo;s room enough in your child&rsquo;s mouth to accommodate all the permanent teeth that will be arriving soon, you&rsquo;re good to go. But if it looks like there won&rsquo;t be enough space for those adult teeth, there are solutions we can offer to make the transition from baby teeth to adult teeth a smoother one.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your child&rsquo;s mouth is small, the permanent teeth might have too little room to fit in when they arrive. We may recommend gently enlarging the upper dental arch with the use of a palatal expander. This device will provide room for the adult teeth, and could potentially shorten second phase treatment time.</li>
<li>Too much space can also be a problem. If a child loses a baby tooth too soon, too much space between the remaining teeth can cause them to shift out of position, leaving the wrong spot open for the adult tooth to come in. We might recommend a space maintainer so that there is no shifting of the teeth, and there is room for the adult tooth to erupt in its proper spot.</li>
<li>If there is a bite problem, early treatment can prevent more serious problems down the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no treatment is necessary immediately, we can monitor the development of your child&rsquo;s teeth and bite during periodic visits.</p>
<p><strong>(Stay in) The Right Places</strong></p>
<p>Once your child has achieved that perfect smile, it&rsquo;s time to maintain it. Teeth actually move and shift throughout our lives, whether we have had orthodontic treatment or not. But with orthodontic treatment, the bone tissue and ligaments around the teeth remodel over time to hold the teeth in their new and improved positions. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s often important to wear a retainer constantly for several months after the braces come off, as bone and ligament become a firm, strong anchor for the newly aligned teeth and bite.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no one expiration date on retainers! Worn nightly as needed, they help teeth stay securely in their new positions for a lifetime of beautiful smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Smiles Mean Happy Faces</strong></p>
<p>If you think your child is ready for any phase of orthodontic work, give us a call. We will be happy to make sure there is ample room for permanent teeth to erupt in their proper spots even during the baby teeth years. If braces are indicated at a later date, we will analyze any potential alignment and bite problems and present all of your treatment options. Finally, after the orthodontic work is completed, we want to make sure your child knows the best way to maintain that beautiful smile with conscientious retainer wear.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about your child&rsquo;s teeth or bite, even before the permanent teeth arrive, give our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office a call. Early treatment can often prevent future problems and might even lead to faster orthodontic results. At each stage of your child&rsquo;s growth, we are here to provide your best options for healthy, happy smiles.</p>

<p>When you replace your old toothbrush every three or four months with a new model, you accomplish three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You keep your teeth cleaner (frayed brushes don&rsquo;t clean as well)</li>
<li>You protect your gums (you won&rsquo;t be scrubbing harder to get your teeth clean)</li>
<li>You add another toothbrush to your growing collection of used brushes</li>
</ul>
<p>If creative recycling is one of your talents, you might have already discovered how handy repurposed brushes are for cleaning delicate or hard-to-reach spaces around the house. But those old brushes don&rsquo;t have to spend their entire existence cleaning! Here are some ideas from Drs. Insoft and Hurst to give a new, artistic life to your old, uninspired toothbrush.</p>
<ul>
<li>Splatter Painting</li>
</ul>
<p>As your bathroom mirror can confirm, toothbrushes are great for splattering. Why not put those bristles to creative use by adding color bursts to canvas, wooden picture frames or boxes, fabric, cards, gift wrap and more? Just dip the tips of the bristles into the paint, point them toward your surface, and brush your finger over the head. For more formal effects, splatter paint over your favorite stencils on paper or fabric. Or work your magic by splattering around a stencil for a dramatic silhouette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Children&rsquo;s Painting</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child might find it great fun to use an old toothbrush to create new works of art. The easy-to-grip handle and wide bristles are perfect for painting those first masterpieces. Splatter painting is also a wonderful art activity for children&mdash;but be prepared for some clean-up!</p>
<p>Texturizing Clay Pieces</p>
<p>Whether you work in potter&rsquo;s clay, polymer clay, or Play-Doh, an old toothbrush can provide any number of interesting textures to your piece. Press the bristles into the clay for a sophisticated stippled background, or brush long gentle strokes for a striated effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carpentry</li>
</ul>
<p>Wood glue creates strong bonds when you are joining edges, mitering corners, or fitting mortise and tenon joints. It also creates a sticky mess when you use your fingers, a wood or plastic spreader, or one of your good paint brushes. For any gluing jobs or joinery, try a toothbrush for greater control and easy application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jewelry Making</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work with jewelry pieces, you know that sometimes there are nooks and crannies that are almost impossible to clean or polish. Try a gentle brush with an old toothbrush and the recommended polish for your piece&mdash;but do keep brushes away from the delicate surface of pearls. And for the boldly creative, why not use your toothbrush itself as jewelry? There are online instructions out there for transforming that old brush into a colorful bangle bracelet.</p>
<p>In turns out that there&rsquo;s a second career waiting for your toothbrush after all! Make sure to clean your toothbrushes thoroughly before using them in another role. After that, let your creativity run wild&mdash;including your creative recycling! It&rsquo;s just another way you are crafting a more beautiful environment for all of us.</p>

<p>You found the perfect toothbrush! The bristles are soft, to avoid irritating your delicate gum tissue. The angle of the bristles is perfect for removing plaque. The handle is durable and comfortable when you spend at least two minutes brushing in the morning and two at night. Why, you love this toothbrush and you&rsquo;ll never let it go&hellip; for the next three or four months.</p>
<p>The life of a toothbrush is naturally a short one. Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team recommend replacement every three to four months because the bristles become frayed and worn with daily use. They cannot clean as effectively when the bristles begin to break down, and, depending on your brushing style, may wear out even more rapidly. (Children will probably need to replace toothbrushes at least every three months.) But even in the short time you have your toothbrush, there are ways to keep it ready for healthy brushing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t share</strong>. While sharing is normally a virtue, sharing toothbrushes can lead to an increased risk of infections, especially for those with compromised immune systems or existing infectious diseases. Similarly, keep different brushes separate when drying to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Rinse thoroughly after brushing</strong>. Make sure to remove any toothpaste or debris left after you brush.</li>
<li><strong>Store the brush upright</strong>. Air-drying is the preferred way to dry your brush, as covering the brush or keeping it in a closed container can promote the growth of bacteria more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several products on the market that promise to sanitize your brush. The verdict is still out on its success, but if you or someone in your home has a compromised immune system, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office to see if it might be worth your while to check them out.</p>
<p>Even though your toothbrush won&rsquo;t be with you long, make its stay as effective and hygienic as possible. And if you find a brush you love&mdash;stock up!</p>

<p>When you leave on a trip, you probably double-check that evrything&rsquo;s ready: your clothes are packed, your ticket is handy, and your passport waits patiently on top of your bag or in a special pocket.</p>
<p>The same level of preparedness should apply with regard to caring for your oral health when you&rsquo;re about to leave home for a while. Whether you&rsquo;re jumping in the car for a weekend camping trip or flying halfway across the globe for a longer stint, the tips below will help you keep your teeth healthy whil you&rsquo;re away.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare Ahead of Time</strong></p>
<p>The key to maintaining good oral hygiene during travel is preparation. Schedule a regular dental appointment so your teeth are freshly cleaned and ready before you leave. This can identify potential issues that might cause problems while you&rsquo;re away.</p>
<p>If you have any items on a dental &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list, such as wisdom tooth removal, replacement of a filling, or orthodontic adjustment, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get those procedures completed before your trip.</p>
<p><strong>En Route</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re stuck on a long flight or trekking far into the woods, you might find yourself where there&rsquo;s no sink or even a toothbrush at hand. We speak for everyone when we say that nothing is worse than a mouth that feels, shall we say, less than fresh.</p>
<p>A lemon wedge or Granny Smith apple slice can help freshen up your breath when you&rsquo;re in need of a quick fix. Rinsing your mouth thoroughly with water can help to wash away bacteria that causes cavities and reduce that gritty sensation. If you&rsquo;ve got toothpaste, put a dot on your finger or a damp washcloth to serve as a makeshift toothbrush.</p>
<p>Nowadays, travel-sized dental products are available at most grocery stores and pharmacies. You can find travel toothbrushes, mini mouthwashes, and pocket-sized floss to slip into your travel bag.</p>
<p>Colgate makes disposable mini-toothbrushes called Wisps that can help you freshen up when you may not have access to a regular toothbrush. Packing a few extra dental supplies may also be a good idea in case one gets damaged or lost.</p>
<p><strong>At Your Destination</strong></p>
<p>Traveling abroad can expose you to unfamiliar conditions. Some countries have compromised water sources that will make you extremely ill if ingested, even from the tiny amount of water with which you wet your toothbrush.</p>
<p>Minimize that risk and keep bottles of water on hand instead for rinsing your mouth and toothbrush. If your toothbrush comes in contact with contaminated water, swapping it out for a new one is the safest option.</p>
<p>Storing your toothbrush properly is necessary to prevent bacteria from growing on it. Place your brush in a Ziploc bag when you&rsquo;re on the go and allow it to breathe once you get to a temporary destination.</p>
<p>Traveling near or far should be an enjoyable experience. Dental issues shouldn&rsquo;t be a source of worry on your vacation. As long as you&rsquo;re prepared and take precautions, your teeth can stay healthy even when they&rsquo;re out of the country!</p>
<p>Of course, if you have any questions, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, we would all jump out of bed ready to greet the day with a big smile and a toothbrush close at hand to clean our teeth immediately. But if you can&rsquo;t even <em>find</em> your toothbrush before you&rsquo;ve had your first cup of coffee, does it really make a difference if you brush and floss after breakfast? Perhaps! Let&rsquo;s talk biology.</p>
<p>Normal saliva production during the day benefits our teeth and mouths in surprising ways. Saliva washes away food particles to keep our teeth cleaner. It contains cells which combat bacteria and infection. It even provides proteins and minerals to help protect our teeth from decay. But saliva production slows dramatically as we sleep, and the amount of bacteria in our mouths increases. While one of the nasty&mdash;and obvious&mdash;side effects of bacterial growth is morning breath, there is an invisible effect, which is more harmful. Bacteria in plaque convert sugar and carbohydrates into acids which attack our gums and enamel and can lead to both gingivitis and cavities.</p>
<ul>
<li>If You Brush Before Breakfast</li>
</ul>
<p>Brushing and flossing first thing in the morning removes the plaque that has built up during the night and takes care of many of the bacteria who are ready to enjoy the sugar and carbs in that breakfast with you. If you brush before eating breakfast, rinse your mouth with water after your meal, floss if needed, and you are good to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>If You Choose to Brush After Breakfast</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you decide that doughnut simply can&rsquo;t wait, you should ideally postpone brushing for 20-30 minutes after your meal. Of course, these are minutes in which bacteria can make use of those new sugars and carbohydrates. So why shouldn&rsquo;t you brush immediately after eating? Many foods and beverages, especially acidic ones such as grapefruit and orange juice, can weaken the surface of your teeth. If you rinse with water after eating and wait at least 20-30 minutes before brushing, your enamel will be &ldquo;remineralized&rdquo; (another benefit of saliva) and ready for cleaning.</p>
<p>No matter if you take a &ldquo;seize the day&rdquo; approach and brush first thing in the morning, or a &ldquo;seize the doughnut&rdquo; approach and brush soon after eating, the important word here is &ldquo;brushing.&rdquo; Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL team are happy to make suggestions as to the best morning routine for you. One thing <em>is</em> certain: if you give your teeth and gums two minutes of careful brushing and flossing in the morning, you can&rsquo;t help but start your day off right!</p>

<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is the holiday to celebrate all the treasured relationships in your life. It&rsquo;s a time to honor love in all shapes and forms with cards, social gatherings, and sometimes even binge eating of sweets.</p>
<p>It's hard to look the other way when grocery stores and pharmacies are invaded with goodies connected to the Valentine&rsquo;s Day theme, and especially if you&rsquo;re on the receiving end of some of these sweets. We get it. In fact, we&rsquo;re all for it!</p>
<p>However, we also support a cavity-free smile. So in the interest of your dental and general health, and because we think it&rsquo;s genuinely tasty, Drs. Insoft and Hurst recommends an alternative to the Valentine treats you may be accustomed to: dark chocolate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yes, Healthy Chocolate Exists</strong></p>
<p>Studies have shown that dark chocolate is high in flavonoids, an ingredient found in the cocoa beans used to make chocolate. Flavonoids can help protect the body against toxins, reduce blood pressure, and improve blood flow to the heart and brain.</p>
<p>By opting for dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate, you get to reap these benefits! Pretty sweet, right? Just make sure to stick to high-quality dark chocolates that have undergone minimal processing.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Chocolate, AKA Protector of Teeth </strong></p>
<p>Not only does dark chocolate provide some nice benefits for your overall health, it also helps protect your teeth against cavities! According to the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center, dark chocolate contains high amounts of tannins, another ingredient present in cocoa beans.</p>
<p>Tannins can actually help prevent cavities by interfering with the bacteria that causes them. Think of them as scarecrows for bacteria. They don&rsquo;t always prevail, but isn&rsquo;t it nice to have them there?</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Never Sticky</strong></p>
<p>Unlike many popular candies, dark chocolate is less likely to stick in the crevices of your teeth. Chewy, gooey sweets are more likely to hang around in your mouth for longer periods of time, which means they raise the odds of your harboring cavity-creating bacteria.</p>
<p>While some dark chocolates have additives like caramel or marshmallow, it&rsquo;s best to opt for the plain varieties, which are just as delicious. If you&rsquo;re feeling festive, though, a dark chocolate with caramel is still better than a milk chocolate with caramel, so that&rsquo;s the way to go!</p>
<p>While dark chocolate has some pretty sweet benefits, the most important thing to remember (whether you go the dark chocolate route or not), is that moderation is key. That being said, we hope you have fun satisfying your sweet tooth and shopping for treats for your friends and loved ones. Happy Valentine&rsquo;s Day from all of us at Insoft &amp; Hurst Orthodonitics!</p>

<p>Our pets are a valued part of the family, but dogs and cats are not regularly known for their minty-fresh breath. Did you know that bad breath can be a sign of a more serious dental problem for your furry companion?</p>
<p>If you live with a pet or two, you&rsquo;ll want to brush up on your animal dental knowledge and make sure everyone&rsquo;s teeth stay healthy.</p>
<p>Proper dental care is essential to a pet&rsquo;s overall well-being. About 80 percent of dogs and 70 percent of cats suffer from periodontal disease after the age of three.</p>
<p>Not only is this unhealthy for their mouth, it can lead to more serious health problems, including organ damage and heart failure. Toxins from periodontal disease seep into your pet&rsquo;s bloodstream and have the potential to cause fatal organ damage.</p>
<p>Your veterinarian will check your pet&rsquo;s teeth at an annual or six-month examination, but here are a few signs of periodontal disease you should watch for at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow/brown tartar</li>
<li>Foul breath</li>
<li>Red, inflamed, or bleeding gums</li>
<li>Excessive drooling</li>
<li>Pawing at the mouth or rubbing one&rsquo;s jaw against objects</li>
<li>Difficulty chewing</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from regular checkups at the vet, the best thing you can do for your pet is brush its teeth daily. Bacteria can recolonize onto the surface of teeth within 24 to 36 hours, so it&rsquo;s essential to remove plaque before it turns into tartar. Ask your vet for a recommended toothbrush and pet toothpaste.</p>
<p>Dental hygiene chews can also help to reduce the effects of gingivitis, but some chews can actually make your pet&rsquo;s oral health worse. Treats such as cow hooves, pig&rsquo;s ears, and animal bones can damage teeth and cause other problems if ingested. Your vet can help you choose items that are healthiest for your pet.</p>
<p>Your dog&rsquo;s favorite toys may also pose a threat to their oral health. Abrasive toys such as the popular green tennis balls can create wear and tear on the surface of pets&rsquo; teeth.</p>
<p>As with your own teeth, your dog or cat&rsquo;s oral health plays a large role in its overall health. Remember to schedule regular checkups and ask your veterinarian for more tips on how to care for your pet&rsquo;s teeth most effectively.</p>

<p>If your pre-teen or teenager is home for the summer, it&rsquo;s easy to provide braces-friendly lunch options. The school lunchroom, though, presents another challenge altogether. What menu selections are most compatible with braces? And what can you put in that lunch box or brown bag to provide a tempting, healthy lunch during school hours? Let&rsquo;s look at some options!</p>
<p><strong>From the Cafeteria</strong></p>
<p>Encourage your student to stick with soft foods that don&rsquo;t require biting into. Some good choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soup, either creamy or with soft vegetables</li>
<li>Salads without crunchy vegetables or croutons</li>
<li>Soft, shredded chicken or beef</li>
<li>Egg or tuna salad</li>
<li>Tofu</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Meatloaf</li>
<li>Macaroni and cheese</li>
<li>Soft casseroles</li>
<li>Steamed vegetables</li>
<li>Mashed potatoes</li>
<li>Soft breads or tortillas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bringing a Lunch?</strong></p>
<p>There are many great options for packing a lunch bag! Just remember to keep foods at the proper temperature, with insulated containers for hot foods and two cold sources, such as two frozen gel packs, for cold foods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandwiches with soft filling (no chunky peanut butter!) on soft bread. Thinly sliced, easy to chew cold cuts will work, but cold cuts like salami are too chewy. Cut the crusts off if necessary. Cutting sandwich wedges into smaller portions will also make them easier to eat.</li>
<li>Hard boiled eggs</li>
<li>Hummus and soft pita wedges</li>
<li>String cheese and soft crackers</li>
<li>Applesauce</li>
<li>Yogurt</li>
<li>Soft fruits such as berries or bananas</li>
<li>Jell-O or other gelatin dessert cups</li>
<li>Pudding cups</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to Say &ldquo;No, Thank You&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you have to bite into it, if it&rsquo;s chewy, or if it&rsquo;s crunchy, it&rsquo;s best to choose something else! Here are some common culprits when it comes to broken brackets and wires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caramel</li>
<li>Hard candy</li>
<li>Popcorn</li>
<li>Whole carrots</li>
<li>Whole apples</li>
<li>Hard rolls</li>
<li>Pizza</li>
<li>Corn on the cob</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember to send your child to school with a brush and floss to clean teeth and braces after lunch. Dental hygiene is very important now, because brackets and wires can both trap food particles <em>and</em> make brushing them away more difficult. This can lead to increased plaque, cavities, and staining around the area of the braces. If it&rsquo;s impossible to brush, be sure to remind your student to rinse thoroughly with water after eating.</p>
<p>Lunch hour should be a time to relax, get together with friends, and recharge for the rest of the school day. Talk to us about the most (and least) braces-friendly foods and recipes. By learning what foods to avoid and adjusting some old favorites, your school-age child can continue to enjoy healthy, tasty lunches. Most important, visiting Drs. Insoft and Hurst at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office for an emergency repair will not be on anyone&rsquo;s list of afterschool activities!</p>

  <h3>January 23rd, 2019</h3>
  <div class="entry">

<p>You might be surprised to see one of your second grader&rsquo;s friends with a dental appliance. Isn&rsquo;t orthodontic work just for teenagers? And, if not, should your seven-year-old be sporting braces right now? The answer to both of those questions is &ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo; Two-phase treatment is a process designed to correct issues that arise during different times in your child&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><strong>First Phase Treatment</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that every child have an orthodontic evaluation around the age of seven to determine if there is a problem that would benefit from early treatment. First phase orthodontics is not the same as orthodontics for older patients. The focus here is on the developing bone and muscle structures which form your child&rsquo;s bite and provide space for the permanent teeth when they arrive.</p>
<p>There are some clear-cut orthodontic goals that are much easier to attain when children&rsquo;s bones are still growing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing Crowding</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child&rsquo;s mouth is small, the permanent teeth will have little room to fit in when they arrive. We may recommend gently enlarging the upper dental arch with the use of a palatal expander. This device will provide room for the adult teeth, and could potentially shorten second phase treatment time. Sometimes the extractions necessary to create more room for permanent teeth in later years can be avoided, as well as the possibility of an impacted tooth&mdash;one which doesn&rsquo;t erupt because it is blocked by other teeth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with Jaw and Bite Concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>Bones and muscles do not always develop properly, leading to problems with jaw and facial structure. Your younger child still has growing bones, so this is a great time to gently re-form the jaw into a healthy shape. Problems caused by crossbites, underbites, open bites, and other malocclusions can be reduced with early treatment. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting Teeth</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child has protruding front teeth, these teeth are more likely to be damaged in falls, at play, or while participating in sports. We can gently reposition them.</p>
<p><strong>Second Phase Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Second phase treatment is designed for your older child. After a resting period, when the permanent teeth finish erupting, we should see your child to evaluate any further orthodontic needs. This is the time to finish the process of straightening the teeth and making sure that each tooth fits together properly for a comfortable and healthy bite. This phase usually makes use of braces or aligners, and can take approximately 12-24 months.</p>
<p>Two-phase treatment is not necessary for every child. But there are some unique reasons that early orthodontics might be recommended for your child, even if it&rsquo;s clear that more orthodontic work will be needed later. Make an appointment with Drs. Insoft and Hurst at our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office, and let&rsquo;s evaluate your child&rsquo;s orthodontic needs, whether now or in the future, for a lifetime of beautiful smiles.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re heading out for a day with friends or running from classroom to volleyball practice, you don&rsquo;t always have the luxury of taking care of your braces or aligners in the comfort of your home. But don&rsquo;t stress! Here are some suggestions for handy items you can take with you to handle most of the dental situations that might come up.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Care Kit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel Toothbrush&mdash;the perfect size for quick cleanings after a meal on the go. You might want to bring a travel size tube of toothpaste as well.</li>
<li>Dental Floss, Threader, and Dental Picks&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want something stuck in your teeth or braces through three hours of play rehearsal.</li>
<li>Water Bottle&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t have time to brush, a good rinse will help keep teeth <em>and</em> appliances clean.</li>
<li>Small Mirror&mdash;to make sure your smile is picture perfect after eating.</li>
<li>Our office phone number&mdash;just in case. If something happens to your braces or aligners, or if you suffer a dental emergency, call our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Braces</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Orthodontic Wax&mdash;if one of your brackets is irritating your mouth, you&rsquo;ll be ready.</li>
<li>Braces-Friendly Snacks&mdash;soft, healthy foods that will help keep your energy up while keeping your braces intact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Aligners or a Retainer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your case! If you need to take your aligners or retainer out, use your case to protect them and keep them from getting lost. You have better things to do after lunch than sifting through a garbage can full of used napkins. Much better things.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these items can fit easily in a case or bag in your glove compartment, locker, or backpack. Want more tips? Talk to Drs. Insoft and Hurst and our team on your next visit, and let&rsquo;s work together to make caring for your orthodontic appliances a quick and convenient addition to your busy schedule!</p>

<p>Breakfast is called the most important meal of the day for many reasons. Children need to refuel after a long night&rsquo;s sleep, and studies suggest that school kids who eat a good breakfast have more energy, better attendance and behavior, and even higher test scores than kids who don&rsquo;t. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But sometimes, especially with new braces or braces that have just been adjusted, the last thing on your child&rsquo;s mind is breakfast. Fortunately, Drs. Insoft and Hurst can recommend many early morning options that will be both gentle on braces and healthy for growing bodies!</p>
<ul>
<li>Yogurt</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft, creamy, and filled with calcium and vitamin D, yogurt is an easy and nutritious choice. Try different fruit flavors or Greek yogurt for variety.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>Packed with protein, scrambled eggs are delicious on their own, or with the addition of cheese or soft veggies. If you&rsquo;d like to add a bit of flair to the table, a cheese omelet is another great choice. Any egg option is a good one&mdash;just remember to skip the crunchy toast on the side.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoothies</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only a great way to start your day, but a great way to get vitamins and minerals in one delicious meal. And with a flavor base of banana, mango, berries, or apple, no one will notice if some spinach or kale make their way into the blender!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oatmeal</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately for the cereal lover, crunchy cereals and even granola are potentially damaging to wires and brackets. But oatmeal is a healthy alternative that can be made even tastier with the addition of soft fruits such as mangos, berries, and bananas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breads and Pastries</li>
</ul>
<p>Crunchy and chewy breads and pastries can lead to broken brackets and wires. Soft breads, pancakes, non-crunchy French toast, and soft pastries are much kinder to braces. Because so many of these options are rich in sugar (especially with syrup!), it&rsquo;s best to go lighter on foods like this and be sure to brush carefully afterward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>
</ul>
<p>Bananas, peaches, nectarines, berries&mdash;if it&rsquo;s soft, it&rsquo;s good to go! Cut larger fruits into bite-sized pieces. Dried fruits like raisins, dates, and cranberries can be chewy, sticky, <em>and</em> sugary, so best to take them off the shopping list for the time being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s described as the most important meal of the day for many good reasons. With some of these easy-to-prepare breakfasts, you can add delicious, healthy, and braces-friendly to that description! If you stumble on a delicious recipe, don&rsquo;t forget to share it the next time you visit our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office!</p>

<p>Just because it&rsquo;s cold out there doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll give up keeping fit and active! Winter is the season for some of our favorite team sporting activities, and when you&rsquo;re donning your protective gear, don&rsquo;t forget to protect your teeth as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basketball</li>
</ul>
<p>This sport actually tallies one of the highest counts of dental injuries. Running, jumping, and diving for the ball on an unforgiving court can lead to tooth and jaw injuries. &nbsp;And for every ten men on the floor, it seems like there at least 50 flailing elbows in the paint.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hockey</li>
</ul>
<p>Notorious for the toll it takes on teeth, hockey is a game of sticks, ice, and whizzing pucks. And when your sport&rsquo;s penalties include the terms hooking, slashing, and tripping, the more protection, the better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skiing</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are flying down the slopes, combining powdery snow and speed, mouth protection is a good idea. This also applies to snowboarding and other snow sports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrestling</li>
</ul>
<p>Grappling and pinning in close quarters can lead to unintended injuries after accidental contact with the mat or your opponent.</p>
<p>Different uniforms, different equipment, and different playing fields, but all these sports have one thing in common&mdash;the easiest way to protect your teeth while playing them is with a mouth guard.</p>
<p><strong>Mouthguards generally come in three forms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the counter, ready-made appliances. These are available in drugstores and sporting goods stores, but might not be a comfortable fit as they are pre-formed sizes.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;boil-and-bite&rdquo; option is a mouthguard form placed in hot water. You then bite down to shape it to your mouth and teeth.</li>
<li>Custom mouthguards can be fabricated just for you through our St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL office. These appliances are designed to fit your individual mouth and teeth, so provide a better fit and better protection. They are also usually more durable and more comfortable. If you wear braces, you definitely need a custom mouthguard to prevent an injury to your mouth or braces caused by an ill-fitting appliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you play on a team or pursue individual athletic activities, keeping safe as you keep fit is your first priority. We would be happy to discuss your mouthguard options for any sport, any time of year.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been celebrating the new year for a really, really long time. It goes way back, but it started formally in 1582, when Pope George XIII made January 1<sup>st</sup> the official holiday for ushering in the new year. The idea was to yell, cheer, and blow horns to scare away all the evil spirits of the previous year with the hope that the new one would be filled with happiness and opportunity.</p>
<p>While scaring away evil spirits isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s on our mind these days, we still ring in the New Year by cheering and hollering with friends and family. It&rsquo;s a time to set new goals, refocus on old ones, and look forward to all the surprises the coming year will bring.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re saying hello to the New Year snuggled up at home on your couch in the St. Petersburg or Seminole, FL area or by gathering your friends for a social celebration, here are some tips to help ensure you welcome this new chapter with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for a great New Year&rsquo;s Eve celebration from Insoft &amp; Hurst Orthodonitics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay safe.</strong> This one&rsquo;s vital, because nothing puts a damper on your party like an emergency trip to the hospital. Stay responsible and try to plan ahead, whether that means taking a taxi, staying with a friend, or recruiting a designated driver. Do what you have to do to keep yourself and everyone around you safe.</li>
<li><strong>Spend time with the people you love most.</strong> The way we see it, the whole point of the holiday season is to cherish your family and friends. Regardless of what you&rsquo;re doing, make sure there&rsquo;s something for everyone. It&rsquo;s essential to do something the whole group will enjoy!</li>
<li><strong>Smile!</strong> Whether you get all dressed to go out or have a quiet gathering with family and friends, make sure you accessorize with a smile. There&rsquo;s always something to smile about!</li>
</ul>
<p>We can all agree that change can be scary sometimes, but ringing in the New Year is an observance we all welcome with open arms. We hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy this transitional holiday in a fun, healthy, and safe way. You have endless possibilities ahead of you!</p>
<p>From Drs. Insoft and Hurst, have a fantastic New Year!</p>
